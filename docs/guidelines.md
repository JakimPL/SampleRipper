# Coding Guidelines

## General

1. Keep code modularized around clear ownership boundaries.
1. If a function has several meaningful steps, split them into helpers with one clear responsibility.
1. Run `just format` (isort + black, line length 120) then `just lint` (mypy strict + pylint + import-linter) after each change; the pre-commit hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` enforce the formatting, `just test` runs the tests but the pipeline scenarios, and `just check` runs everything a push needs.
1. Do not abbreviate variable names. Use `note`, not `n`.
1. Use American English everywhere: identifiers, comments, docstrings and documentation. Write `color`, `behavior`, `cataloged`, `normalize`. Names imported from a third-party package keep that package's own spelling.
1. Avoid hardcoded semantic values. Prefer `Final` constants, and move them to a shared module when the concept is reused.
1. Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path`.
1. Prefer protocols over inheritance.
1. Separate function options with `*`. Positional arguments should be intentionally chosen.
1. Prefer `match` statements over long `isinstance` chains, and for enumeration handling.
1. Do not preserve backward compatibility for internal APIs, configs, or data shapes unless the user explicitly asks for it.
1. Avoid _tramp data_ antipattern.
1. Be cautious about optional parameters. All variables upon which the logic relies cannot be optional, including configuration instances.
1. Restrict yourself from using default values for non-optional fields, excluding these that are not meant to be frequently changed (e.g. seed). If you do use defaults, declare a `Final` top-level constant for that.
1. Be explicit about type expectations. Avoid dynamic `getattr` or `hasattr`.
1. Prefer computable properties over stored boolean variables. A boolean derived from existing state should be a `@property` (or `@computed_field` on a Pydantic model) rather than a field that must be kept in sync manually. Stored booleans create hidden state branches that are easy to leave inconsistent.

## Shared Ownership

1. Refer to [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the package ownership map (which package owns what).
1. General-purpose helpers that are not model-specific belong in `samplecore`, not inside a feature package.
1. Each package names its files in its own `paths.py`, which holds the package's single `Path(__file__)` anchor. `samplecore/paths.py` also names the source checkout's files and the application's folders for the user, and `scripts/paths.py` and `tests/paths.py` name the repository's. Every other module imports its paths from these.
1. Generated files live in three top-level folders: `build/` holds intermediate outputs (the frontend bundle, the API schemas, the wheel and its pinned requirements), `bin/` the executable, and `dist/` what a release publishes. Source folders hold source alone. The frontend bundle's folder is named in three places that cannot share a definition: `frontend/vite.config.ts` writes it, and `samplecore/paths.py` and `hatch_build.py` read it.
1. Do not create delegated imports or re-export modules just so other modules can import through them.
1. Import shared helpers directly from the module that owns their implementation.
1. Before adding a helper, search the repository for existing logic with `rg`.
1. If new code duplicates existing logic, extract the shared rule first and make both call sites use it.
1. `__init__` must not expose anything outside its own package's tree hierarchy.
1. Do not overload a single module with too many different responsibilities.
1. Prefer subpackages over flattened directory structure.
1. Wrap an external command-line tool or third-party library behind our own typed interface in the module that owns that boundary, and probe availability at runtime so callers degrade gracefully rather than branching on the environment themselves. A comment naming the third-party behavior is warranted there.
1. Package boundaries in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.importlinter]` contracts are load-bearing, not advisory — `just lint` fails if `samplecore` gains a dependent-facing import, or if `sampleserver` imports any pipeline package.

## Type Hints

1. Specify all input and return types in function signatures, including `None`.
1. Fill generic types. Use `dict[str, int]`, not a bare `dict`.
1. Do not cast/silence type errors unless the boundary is an untyped or mistyped third-party API.
1. Avoid `Any` and `object` unless the boundary genuinely accepts arbitrary data.
1. Do not quote type names. Put `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module (the house default), and reach for `Self` or `TYPE_CHECKING` where they help.
1. Prefer modern built-in generics and union syntax: `dict[str, int]` over `Dict[str, int]`, `tuple[int, ...]` over `Tuple`, `X | None` over `Optional[X]`. With `from __future__ import annotations` on, these are the standard across the codebase.
1. Validate with `mypy`.

## Error Handling

1. Let failures crash unless the code can recover meaningfully.
1. Handle errors at the execution boundary when possible.
1. Do not add `try`/`except` blocks that only repackage failures without recovery.
1. Bare `except` and `except Exception` are forbidden.
1. Error handling blocks should cover only the code that is subject to a failure, unless there is a valid reason.

## Models

1. Prefer Pydantic models for validated or serialized data.
1. Use `frozen` when instances are not meant to change.
1. Dataclasses are acceptable for small internal state objects that are not serialized or validated, including test case dataclasses.

## Documentation

1. Documentation should explain the intention of a class/function and context of usage.
1. State functionality in positive terms. Describe what a class or function *does* — not what it avoids, omits, skips, differs from, or no longer does. Reframe every negation ("does not", "rather than", "instead of", "without", "never", "cannot", "no longer") into the behavior that actually happens. Do not contrast with rejected alternatives as justification; the positive statement carries the meaning.
1. Negative phrasing is allowed only where the condition itself is the contract: exception triggers in `Raises:` clauses, precondition/postcondition bounds (prefer "must be at least X" over "cannot be less than X" where natural), and documented edge-case returns. Outside these concrete cases, negative descriptions are information noise and must be removed.
1. An experiment record stands on its own for a reader who sees this repository and nothing else. State what was run, over how much, and what came out; give every number the record relies on in the record. Artifacts that live beside the library — run directories, logs, caches, weights, CSV tables, rendered audio — are named by what they are, never cited as a path the reader is expected to open.
1. If a function makes a non-obvious decision, the logic should be explained with a justification for arbitrary choices in docstrings, not code comments. Frame the justification positively (what the choice achieves), not as the failure it sidesteps.
1. Avoid comments and docstrings that restate code.
1. Use clear names instead of explanatory comments.
1. Avoid code comments. Comments are acceptable for tensor/array shapes, third-party API quirks, or non-obvious invariants.
1. Code comments and docstrings are not for documenting changes nor progress.
1. Don't write module docstrings.
1. The justfile holds the recipes alone. Describe each recipe in the guide that lists it: `development.md`, `source.md` or `building.md`.

## Messages

1. Keep every sentence a person reads in a messages module or the web app's catalog, one constant or id per sentence, so wording changes and translations touch one place.
1. A message that reaches the web app travels as a `Problem` (a `MessageCode` with its values), and the web app words it.
1. Write messages in plain American English for the person who reads them, and name what they can do next.

## Tests

1. Test files should mirror the ownership of the functionality under test.
1. When moving functionality between packages, move its direct unit tests in the same change.
1. Parametrize test functions of the same body and use test case dataclasses.
1. Use a test scenario suite class for defining more complex steps defined as a series of functions with assertions.
1. Prefer fixtures over factories. Define shared fixtures in an appropriate place.
1. Do not assert default values of configurations, layouts, settings, and similar. Defaults are not contracts, and pinning them overconstrains the tests. Test behavior instead: validation bounds, serialization round-trips, and invariants. The exception is when values must match by contract rather than equal a chosen constant — e.g. a module's own hash after a round trip should be asserted to match, never hardcoded to a literal.
1. Assert which message appeared, never its spelling: tests name a message by its id or constant, or by the `MessageCode` the server sent.
1. Do not assert shipped values: a sentence, a URL or a name the code ships, retyped into an expectation, is a second copy of it that fails on every rewording and proves nothing. Assert behavior through roles and structure, the test's own fixture values showing up in the output, or equality with the constant the code itself reads, imported from the module that owns it. Choosing a control by its accessible name is interaction, and stays.
1. Unit tests may mock system boundaries (file I/O, external services, database connections where appropriate), but must not mock the domain logic that is the subject of the test. Integration tests must exercise real computation pipelines against real (synthetically built) data.
1. When a test expectation diverges from the production code's actual behavior, determine which is wrong before acting. A failing test is evidence of a potential bug in the production code unless the test itself is demonstrably incorrect (wrong imports, misread API contract, incorrect fixture). Never silently delete or weaken a test to make it pass. If uncertain, flag the divergence explicitly and ask before changing either side.
