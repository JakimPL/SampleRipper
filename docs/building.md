# Building and releasing

This guide is for building the SampleRipper executables and their installers, and for publishing a
release. Running the app from a checkout takes [Running from source](source.md) alone.

## What gets built

```
build/
  frontend/               the built web app
  package/                the sampleripper wheel, which carries the web app, and each launcher's requirements
bin/
  SampleRipper           the processor launcher (SampleRipper.exe on Windows)
  SampleRipper-nvidia    the NVIDIA launcher, on Windows and Linux
dist/                     what a release publishes
  SampleRipper-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe
  SampleRipper-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg
  SampleRipper-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage
  descriptor/             the pretrained descriptor, when you publish a new one
```

Each system builds its own executables and installer: build on Windows for Windows, on a Mac with
Apple silicon for macOS, and on Linux for Linux. The Application workflow builds all three on GitHub
(see [Continuous integration](#continuous-integration)).

## Prerequisites

Everything [Running from source](source.md#requirements) lists, and for each step:

| Step | Needs |
|---|---|
| `just package` | Node.js and npm, and uv |
| `just executable` | Rust, installed with [rustup](https://rustup.rs): cargo compiles the launchers |
| `just installer` on Windows | [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 6.3 or later |
| `just installer` on macOS | `codesign` and `hdiutil`, which come with macOS |
| `just installer` on Linux | appimagetool, which the build downloads itself |

## Building

```sh
just package      # build/: the web app, the wheel carrying it, and each launcher's requirements
just executable   # bin/: the launchers for this system
just installer    # dist/: the installer for this system
```

`just app-build` runs the three in turn.

- `just package` builds the web app and the sampleripper wheel. It also writes the exact versions
  the app installs, taken from `uv.lock`, twice: with torch's processor build, which runs on every
  machine, and with its CUDA build and NVIDIA libraries, several gigabytes more, for a machine with
  an NVIDIA card.
- `just executable` compiles a [PyApp](https://ofek.dev/pyapp/) launcher around a copy of the wheel
  carrying each set of versions: `SampleRipper` everywhere, and `SampleRipper-nvidia` on Windows
  and Linux, where PyTorch publishes CUDA builds. Each wheel's version carries a label with a
  digest of what the wheel holds, after `cu128` for the NVIDIA one, such as
  `0.1.1+cu128.3fa9c01b2d4e`. On its first start, a launcher downloads Python and installs the app
  with uv into a folder named after that version, which takes several minutes; later starts take
  seconds.
- `just installer` wraps the launchers for its system:
  - The Windows installer carries both launchers and installs the NVIDIA one where `nvidia-smi`
    reports a driver for CUDA 12 or newer. It puts the app in the person's own programs folder,
    with a Start menu shortcut and an optional desktop one. Upgrading and uninstalling first quit
    the running app with the installed interpreter's `-m sampleripper.app --quit`, end whatever
    still runs from its packages a minute later, and remove the packages the earlier version
    installed; the library stays.
  - The macOS disk image holds an app bundle whose launcher sends the app's output to the log
    folder and announces the first start. The bundle carries an ad hoc signature.
  - The Linux AppImage carries both launchers too. Its AppRun picks one on the first start by the
    same `nvidia-smi` check, and records the choice in `~/.config/SampleRipper/launcher`, which
    every later start follows. It sends the app's output to the log folder and announces the first
    start with a desktop notification.
  - Every installer's icon is cut from the web app's `icon-512.png`, which `just icons` renders,
    with the other PNG icons, from the logo's source, `frontend/public/favicon.svg`. Run it after
    changing the logo.

## Trying a build

Run `bin/SampleRipper`, or `bin/SampleRipper-nvidia` on a machine with an NVIDIA card: it
installs itself, starts, and opens your browser, as an installed copy does. Every build that
changes the code, the web app or the pinned versions installs afresh on its first start, with the
project's version unchanged, and a build of the same contents starts on the packages already
installed. Before `just executable` replaces a launcher in `bin/` with one of new contents, it quits
the app the old launcher installed and deletes that installation. `self remove`, such as
`bin/SampleRipper self remove`, deletes a launcher's installation by hand, so the next start
installs afresh. The installations live in PyApp's data folder:
`~/.local/share/pyapp` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/pyapp` on macOS and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\pyapp\data` on Windows.

## Continuous integration

The Application workflow (`.github/workflows/app.yml`) builds everything on GitHub:

1. It checks the inputs of the build (see [Releasing](#releasing)) and runs `just package` once.
2. On Linux, Windows and macOS, it runs `just executable`, then installs each launcher on the fresh
   machine and walks it through a first session (`scripts/smoke_test_app.py`). The session writes 30
   generated modules, opens a library on the built-in database, and builds its catalog. A second
   start must then leave the running app in place, and `--quit` must end it and stop its database. The runners have no NVIDIA card, so the NVIDIA launcher's
   session runs on the processor, which shows that its packages install and start. Then it runs
   `just installer`.
3. Each run keeps the executables and installers it built, to download from the run's page. A run
   whose smoke test fails keeps the library's logs as well.

Start a run from the repository's Actions tab: **Application**, then **Run workflow**. That button
appears once the workflow is on the default branch.

## Releasing

1. **Set the version** in `pyproject.toml`. Every release takes a new version, since an executable
   reuses the packages it installed for a version it has seen.
2. **Publish the pretrained descriptor**, when it changed. After training it on your library, run
   `just release-descriptor <tag>`, such as `just release-descriptor descriptor-1`. It writes the file
   to upload into `dist/descriptor/`, and the record new libraries download it by into
   `src/sampledescriptor/pretrained.toml`. Create a GitHub release with that tag, upload the file to
   it, and commit the record. The workflow downloads the file and checks it against the record.
   A version carrying no record builds each library's cloud by training a descriptor on it.
3. **Tag the release** and push the tag, such as `git tag v0.1.0` and `git push origin v0.1.0`. The
   tag must name the version from step 1.
4. **Publish the draft.** The workflow drafts a GitHub release carrying the three installers.
   Review it, add notes, and publish it.

## Signing

The installers are unsigned, so Windows shows its SmartScreen warning and macOS asks the person to
confirm the app once; the [README](../README.md#install) walks them through both. Signing takes a
code-signing certificate for Windows, and an Apple Developer ID for macOS, where Apple also
notarizes the app.
