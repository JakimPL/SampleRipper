# Architecture & Ownership

SampleRipper turns a personal collection of tracker modules, and folders of plain audio files
beside it, into a browsable, deduplicated sample library: a Postgres catalog of modules, samples,
their tracker-specific properties and the sample files they were found in; a content-addressable
store of extracted audio; detected equivalence classes between near-duplicate samples; and a web
application for navigating and visualizing all of it. The project has two
natures — an offline, batch-oriented extraction/analysis tool, and a served web app, read-only wherever it is deployed —
kept as seven packages under one `pyproject.toml` so each keeps its own dependency footprint and
its own write/read boundary, enforced by the `[tool.importlinter]` contracts in `pyproject.toml`.

## Package map (`src/`)

| Package | Owns | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `samplecore` | The domain models (`Module`, `Sample`, `SampleProperties` and its tracker-specific subtypes, `SampleRelation`, `Experiment`, `SampleFeatureVector`, `EquivalenceClass`, `SampleSpectralFeature`, `NoteEvent`, `ModuleInstrument`, `SampleAnnotation`), the reading of a hand label as tag paths and the agreement between two of them (`samplecore.labeling`), the Postgres schema and connection helpers, the content-addressable audio store, sample hashing, equivalence-class grouping, spectral-distance computation, the pitch rule that turns an occurrence rate and a pressed key into the one rate a sample is really played at, the anchoring rule that keeps a hand label attached to its sample, the sample files read in place from configured sample directories (`samplecore.sample_files` decodes one into the sample it holds, and `samplecore.storage.sample_audio.SampleAudio` is the one reader of every sample's audio, from the store or from its files), the waveform hygiene every analysis shares (folding to mono, the subsonic high-pass), the auditory front end (`samplecore.auditory`: an ERB-spaced gammatone bank, subband envelopes and the two-lobe modulation spectrum a listener hears flutter and roughness on, designed once as data so a numpy reading and a torch loss apply the same kernels), and the local `LibraryConfig` loader. A leaf: nothing else in this repository. | `psycopg`, `sqlalchemy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pydantic`, `soundfile` |
| `sampleextract` | The offline extraction pipeline: walking the module source directory, parsing modules via `trackmod`, rendering sample audio to the content store, populating the Postgres catalog, scanning the configured sample directories into the catalog in place (`sampleextract.files`, the `sampleripper files` command), spreading either pass over worker processes (`sampleextract.parallel`), computing cached waveform-preview thumbnails, reading each module's patterns for the notes they play (both inline at ingest, and via a standalone backfill pass each) and folding those notes into the rate each sample is heard at, the equivalence-class detection pass, moving hand labels in and out of the catalog, and recording the web pages modules came from (`sampleextract.links`, the `sampleripper links import` command). | `samplecore`, `sqlalchemy`, `trackmod`, `tqdm` |
| `samplecloud` | The offline embedding pipeline for the sample-cloud visualization: pluggable feature extraction (`FeatureExtractor` protocol) scoped to a named `Experiment` so more than one backend or parameter set can extract concurrently without clobbering another's vectors -- two hand-built descriptors, and a pretrained audio-text model behind the `clap` backend (the `teacher` extra) that hears what people would call alike, teaches the descriptor `sampledescriptor` trains, and through its text tower gives every sample a category from a vocabulary of prompts (`samplecloud.categories`, each scoring an `Experiment` of its own), UMAP dimensionality reduction (explicit Euclidean metric) over one chosen experiment, and persistence of each sample's standardized vector and 2D coordinate -- the standardized vector is `samplecore`'s own named spectral-distance metric, reused by `sampleserver`'s distance endpoints. The module layout (`samplecloud.modules`) places each module by the distance between its set of samples and every other module's, over those same vectors. It also owns the evaluation harness (`samplecloud.evaluation`) that scores any experiment's descriptor against the targets the catalog already carries: whether a retuning moves the descriptor, whether it groups what the note events say the library plays alike, and whether it groups what a person labeled alike. Depends on `samplecore`, and on `sampledescriptor` inside its `learned` backend's factory, never on `sampleextract`, so a future heavy embedding backend's dependencies never reach the extraction pipeline or the web server. | `samplecore`, `sampledescriptor` (the `learned` backend), `sqlalchemy`, `librosa`, `umap-learn`, `scikit-learn`, `mlflow` (the `cloud` extra); `torch`, `transformers` (the `teacher` extra) |
| `samplemorph` | The morph renderer: the envelope route, which moves the spectral envelope from one sample's analysis to the other's and sounds an excitation under it. `samplemorph.transport` analyzes a sound into the Gaussian spectrogram the route reads and maps two sounds' courses through time onto each other; `samplemorph.envelope` splits each frame into its cepstral envelope and its excitation and blends the envelopes in decibels, while the excitation sounds as the first sound's, the second's or the two crossfaded with the weight, so a chord stays one chord at every point of the path while its timbre travels. `samplemorph.coordinates` reads a sound's pitch by Hermes's subharmonic summation over constant-Q frames, and the envelope route can glide the excitation from the first sound's pitch to the second's; `samplemorph.vocoders.pghi` makes the magnitude audible by phase gradient heap integration. Held to one sound's course through time, the route is a filter on that sound: its whole path is the cepstral coefficients of the ratio between the two envelopes, which `samplemorph.envelope.response` measures and `samplemorph.envelope.filtering` applies at any weight, so a caller reads a pair once and moves its own weight. `samplemorph.routes` builds the route a selection names (`morph.yaml`: the excitation, the timeline, the envelope drawing and the glide; `morph-filter.yaml` beside it, the drawing a filter is read under) and names it for a status. `samplemorph.service` is the morph inference process (`sampleripper morph serve`), which renders any point between two cataloged samples on request, reading a sample found in a sample directory from the file the request names inside the directories its own configuration lists, and is what the web API dials for a morph; it also hands over the filter between two samples, which holds for every point between them, so a caller rendering its own audio asks once per pair. `morph response` writes that filter from the shell. Depends on `samplecore` only. | `samplecore`, `librosa`, `pghipy`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pyyaml` (the `morph` extra) |
| `sampledescriptor` | The learned descriptor the cloud embeds with: a log-frequency canonicalizer (`sampledescriptor.geometry` lays the grid over the analysis `samplemorph` reads) that turns a sample into a fixed-size sound image on a frequency by duration-fraction grid together with the three conditioners that image was normalized by (where its content sits in pitch, how long it sounds, and how loud it was), and a `Descriptor` (`sampledescriptor.descriptors`) that reads the grid as one vector: distilled from the pretrained listening model, taught by retuned views that a retuning changes nothing, and by the hand labels what the listener calls alike. The frequency axis is logarithmic, which turns a change of playback rate into a translation along it, so the translation is measured, moved out of the grid, and carried as a conditioner. Training (`sampledescriptor.training`) runs under a run tracker and reads a grid cache canonicalized once under the library root; `sampledescriptor.commands` holds the three shell commands (`cache-grids`, `train`, `embed`), and the ones that train import the trainer only when they run. Depends on `samplecore` and on the analysis kernels of `samplemorph`. | `samplecore`, `samplemorph`, `torch`, `lightning`, `threadpoolctl`, `mlflow`, `scikit-learn`, `librosa` (the `descriptor` extra) |
| `sampleserver` | The FastAPI API serving the catalog, cross-references, equivalence classes, spectral distances, stats, and cloud coordinates to the frontend, plus the curation routes recording a person's own decisions about samples, and the morph routes, which relay renders from the inference process over HTTP. `create_app` takes a `ServiceRole`: a reader, what `sampleripper serve` and a deployed site run, serves no route that writes, and a curator, what the SampleRipper app runs, also serves the label write, to the person at the computer it runs on alone (`sampleserver.local_person`). `GET /api/curation/access` tells a page which of the two it talks to. Every route is served under `API_PREFIX` (`/api`), which keeps the whole API inside one path segment and leaves every other path to the single-page application's own routes. The app connects as a service role (see [The three databases](#the-three-databases)): a reader may write nothing at all, and a curator may write labels and nothing else, which Postgres itself enforces. Every catalog read also opens its connection read-only, so a route handler reading the catalog writes nothing under either role. | `samplecore`, `sqlalchemy`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx` (the `server` extra) |
| `sampleripper` | The `sampleripper` command line: one parser naming every operation on the library, which hands the rest of a command line to the module owning that command and imports that module as the command runs, so listing the commands stays instant and each command needs its own package's extras alone. A global `--config` sets `SAMPLERIPPER_CONFIG` and drops any exported `SAMPLERIPPER_DATABASE_URL`, so the file it names supplies the database too, and every process a command starts inherits both -- uvicorn's workers and a pipeline's worker processes included. The dispatcher accepts a command's own arguments only after its name. It also holds the commands that belong to no pipeline: `setup` (the config file and the databases), `reset`, and `tracking uri` / `tracking ui`, and the sandbox's synthetic modules and sample pack (`sampleripper.sandbox`). Every command ends with one of the statuses `samplecore.exit_status.ExitStatus` names: 0 once its work is committed, per-item failures included as warnings, 1 when something broke, 2 for a malformed command line, 3 for a request it refuses, and 4 for a process that outgrew its memory ceiling. `--memory-cap 16G` holds the command and everything it starts to a memory ceiling before it loads anything of its own (`sampleripper.limits`): on Linux the process starts again inside a systemd user scope with swap closed off and reads the ceiling back from its own control group, on Windows it assigns itself to a job object of that name, and a system offering neither refuses a ceiling rather than running uncapped. `--memory-scope` names the scope, which is what another process finds a running step by. When `SAMPLERIPPER_STEP_LOCK` names a lock, the dispatcher holds that Postgres advisory lock for the life of the command, which is how a pipeline recognizes a step still running. It also holds `sampleripper.app`, the application a person runs without a terminal (see [The application](#the-application)). It sits over every other package. | every package above |

## Boundaries the import-linter contracts enforce

- `samplecore` has no dependents among its peers: nothing it does can accidentally couple to the
  extraction pipeline, the embedding pipeline, or the web server.
- `sampleserver` never imports `sampleextract`, `samplecloud`, `samplemorph` or `sampledescriptor`: the read
  API cannot trigger a batch job, and cannot inherit any pipeline's heavier dependencies. The pipelines
  never import `sampleserver` either: they write the catalog the server reads, and meet it there alone.
- `sampleextract` is declared independent of `samplecloud`, `samplemorph` and `sampledescriptor`: extraction
  never waits on embedding, and a change to another pipeline's dependencies never touches it.
- `samplemorph` and `sampledescriptor` never import `samplecloud`, while `samplecloud` may import
  `sampledescriptor`: the cloud is the more general layer, and its `learned` backend loads a descriptor the
  descriptor pipeline trained. The import sits inside that backend's factory, so a pass over a hand-built
  descriptor keeps needing no torch. The descriptor pipeline reaches the cloud through the catalog, writing
  a descriptor's vectors as `sample_feature_vector` rows under an `Experiment` that records the model's
  name, which is how the cloud's evaluation rebuilds the extractor and how a promotion finds the same
  vectors.
- `samplemorph` never imports `sampledescriptor`, `samplecore.tracking`, torch, lightning, mlflow,
  scikit-learn or threadpoolctl, while `sampledescriptor` may import the analysis kernels of `samplemorph`:
  `just serve-inference` needs the `morph` extra alone, and training with its run tracking lives in the
  `descriptor` extra.
- `samplemorph.service` reaches the pipeline alone: it never imports `samplemorph.commands` or any other
  package, and the shell and the service stay independent of each other, two skins over one pipeline. The
  web API reaches the service over HTTP, which is what keeps the analysis stack out of the API process while
  morphs play in the app.
- `sampleripper.app` never imports `samplecloud`, `sampledescriptor`, `samplemorph`, torch or librosa: the
  application runs the pipeline and the renderer as programs of its own, and its own process stays light.
- `sampleripper` sits over every package, and none of them imports it. Each command keeps its
  parser and its `main(argv, prog=...)` in the package that owns the work, so a test runs a command
  the way a shell does.

## Persistence

Postgres is the single authoritative store for all catalog metadata (`Module`, `Sample`,
`SampleProperties` together with its per-tracker `xm_sample_properties`/`it_sample_properties`/
`s3m_sample_properties` tables (MOD carries no properties beyond the shared base, so it has no
table of its own), `sample_file`, `SampleRelation`, `Experiment`, `sample_feature_vector`,
`sample_cloud_coordinates`, `module_cloud_coordinates`, `sample_spectral_feature`,
`sample_thumbnail`, `sample_fingerprint`, `module_instrument`, `note_event`, `module_note_extraction`,
`sample_playback_rate`, `sample_category`, `module_link`, and `cloud_promotion`). Equivalence classes are not a stored table: `samplecore.equivalence_classes`
derives them on request from `SampleRelation` rows, since the relation graph stays small even at
real-catalog scale. The filesystem content-addressable store —
`{library_root}/objects/{hash[0:2]}/{hash}.wav`, one file per unique `Sample` extracted from a
module — is the authoritative store for extracted audio bytes, and a sample found only in a sample
directory keeps its bytes in its own file (see [Samples read in place](#samples-read-in-place)).
Neither is a cache of the other, except that `Sample` rows could in principle be rebuilt by
rehashing the store and the sample directories; that is a recoverability property, not a substitute
for backing up the catalog itself.

`module_link` holds the web page a module came from, keyed by the module's content hash, as
`sampleripper links import` records it from a CSV of module locations and page links: each
location is read under `module_source_directory` and hashed the way extraction hashes it, which
is what names the module, so a byte-identical copy under another name takes the same link. The
table sits on the main metadata beside the module it describes, so a reset empties it with the
rest of the catalog and the file is imported again, and the served listing and detail carry the
link under every exposure.

`sample_feature_vector` holds one `FeatureExtractor` backend's raw output per sample, scoped to an
`Experiment` row (its backend name, parameters, and a human label) rather than a single global
table: two experiments extracting concurrently write disjoint rows, keyed by
`(experiment_id, sample_hash)`, so neither can clobber the other's vectors. `sample_cloud_coordinates`,
`module_cloud_coordinates`, and `sample_spectral_feature` stay singular and global -- they represent
whichever experiment has been deliberately *promoted* (`samplecloud.reduce.reduce_and_persist_coordinates`,
given an explicit `experiment_id`), not per-experiment scratch space. `cloud_promotion` holds one row
naming that experiment, written in the same transaction as the coordinates, which is how a later
pass knows which experiment the cloud shows: `sampleripper cloud embed --resume-promoted` resumes
it rather than opening a new one, and the pipeline's `cloud` step is satisfied once it names the
learned experiment.

Stored objects are written through `samplecore.storage.atomic.write_atomically`: staged beside the
destination, flushed, and moved into place whole, ending with the permissions a plain file gets
under the writing process's umask, so a library one user extracts is readable by a container
running as another. A library written before objects were made readable wants
`chmod -R a+rX objects` under its root once.

`note_event` holds one row per key a module's patterns press, keyed by its grid position
`(module_id, pattern_index, row_index, channel_index)`. Beside the key a cell states, each row
carries the note it actually sounds and the occurrence it reaches, which an instrument's keymap
decides: a keymap routes a key onto a sample *and* the note that sample sounds at, so the key a
composer wrote and the pitch a listener hears are separate values, and Impulse Tracker is the format
that regularly makes them differ. Extraction consumes the keymap and records its outcome, which is
what lets a reader reach the pitch a sample is heard at without holding a routing table of its own.
The rate a sample's frames are really read at follows from that note *and* the occurrence's own
rate together (`rate * 2 ** ((sounded_note - 60) / 12)`, tracker C-5 being the rate's reference
key), which is why the two stay joined wherever they are counted: the same key struck against two
occurrences of one waveform sounds two speeds, and two different pairs meet at one speed -- a
waveform transposed down an octave and played an octave higher sounds exactly as the untransposed
one does. Both pieces of a tracker's own tuning are already in that rate: `trackmod` folds XM's
`relative_note`/`finetune` and MOD's finetune byte into the stored rate at parse time, and IT and
S3M carry the transposition in the keymap the sounded note comes from, so the pair is the whole
story. `samplecore.pitch` owns the rule and rounds an effective rate to whole hertz, tracker rates
being whole numbers and a fraction of a hertz sitting far below hearing.

A key reaching a sample below `minimum_sample_frames` keeps its note and
leaves its slot open, since the catalog holds no occurrence to name; a cell stating no instrument
leaves both open, its routing being a fact about how the song is played rather than what the cell
holds. `module_instrument` records each voice slot the same numbering addresses, with the name its
author gave the voice -- a tracker names an instrument apart from the waveforms its keys reach.
`module_note_extraction` records which modules have been read, so a module whose patterns press no
keys still reads as finished and a resumed pass spares it a second parse.

`sample_playback_rate` holds the one rate each sample is heard at most often, which is what the
whole application plays a sample back at -- a click in the cloud, a listing thumbnail and the
waveform panel all sound the same sample identically because all three read this one number.
Answering it means folding tens of millions of note events against the occurrences they reach, some
fourteen seconds of work over this catalog, so `sampleripper notes` takes it once at the end of its
own pass and writes the whole answer down; a served request reads it per sample. A sample no pattern
plays has no row, and a reader falls back to `choose_dominant_rate` over its occurrences' own rates
-- what a module declares the waveform plays at, which is the closest reading left. Both rules break
a tie towards the lower rate, so a rate drawn from note events and one drawn from occurrence rates
are settled the same way.

A module every one of whose samples falls under `minimum_sample_frames` is ingested and kept like
any other, and stays reachable by its own hash and through `PostgresModuleRepository.list_all` for
the pipelines that walk every module. It is left out of `list_page`/`count`, so browsing passes over
it: a chiptune built from single-cycle waveforms is part of the collection while contributing
nothing to a library of samples. `LibraryStats` still counts every ingested module, that being a
statement about the catalog rather than about what is worth browsing.

## Hand-curated work

`curation.sample_annotation` holds what a person decided about a sample — what it is, as free text;
what they think of it, as a rating from one to five; and whether it belongs in their own collection —
and it is the one thing in this library no pass can rebuild. It therefore sits on a `MetaData` of its
own, in a Postgres schema of its own (`samplecore.storage.curation`), apart from the single
`MetaData` every other table belongs to. Both places this project empties a database —
`sampleripper reset` and the test suite's own teardown — iterate
`database.metadata.sorted_tables` (`samplecore.storage.reset` owns the first), so a table registered on the curation metadata is beyond their
reach by construction rather than by an exemption list somebody has to keep current. For the same
reason it carries no foreign key into the catalog: one would either delete these rows along with the
samples or block the purge outright. A test in `tests/samplecore/storage/test_reset.py` pins exactly
that, seeding an annotation and asserting it survives a full reset.

A label is stored in one canonical spelling, `HI-HAT: CLOSED, LO-FI` — upper case, one space after
each colon and comma, each tag path once, in the order written — which is the spelling it is shown in:
`LabelText` applies `samplecore.labeling.labels.canonical_label` at the model boundary, so every path
that records one — the curation route, a JSONL import, a relink — agrees, and the vocabulary offered
back gathers one entry per wording rather than one per way of typing it.

What a label says is read by `samplecore.labeling`, and every consumer reads it the same way. A
label is a set of tags separated by commas, and each tag is a path whose colons step from a broad
top level to a specification that means something only under it: `HI-HAT: CLOSED, LO-FI` names a
closed hi-hat that is also lo-fi. The whole path is a tag's identity, so `ELECTRIC` under `BASS`
and under `GUITAR` are two tags, and a path asserts every tag above it. Two labels agree by
the overlap of those closed sets, from nothing shared to the same label, which gives graded credit
along the hierarchy -- a closed hi-hat beside an open one earns part of what a closed one would --
and reads a specification as a refinement of an agreement. Tags are attributes a sample carries
side by side, never classes it must pick one of, which is what lets a treatment such as `LO-FI` be
judged apart from a source such as `SNARE`. `sampleripper annotations vocabulary` lists the tags in
use as a tree with counts and names the wording worth a second look: a name standing both as a
top level and as a specification under another, and tags carried by one sample. It reads and changes
nothing; settling the wording stays with the person, in the interface.

One row holds all three decisions, and exists because at least one of them was made — a CHECK
constraint says so, and `SampleAnnotation`'s own validator says so alongside it. Writes carry only
what changed: `PATCH /curation/annotations/{hash}` names a scope and any of `label`, `rating` and
`favorite`, a field left out stays as it is and `null` clears it, so two gestures on one sample — a
label typed while a star is clicked — both land. The route merges the change into each reached
sample's row under a transaction-scoped advisory lock (`samplecore.storage.annotation_writes`), leaves
a member the change does not alter untouched, and removes a row left recording nothing; the answer
lists each sample written with what it holds now, and the members it skipped for want of an anchor.
A change clearing all three decisions of a sample the catalog no longer holds removes its row too.
A label is at most 200 characters and 16 tags. In the app, `annotationWriteQueue` sends one sample's changes in order,
and `annotationStore` shows a change at once and reverts it when the write fails.

`curation.tag_rank` gives every tag path a rank that never moves once given: seeded once from the
labels in the order they were first used, and extended inside the write that first uses a new tag.
The cloud paints a tag by its rank, so a rating written on an old label leaves every color where it
was.

Because a sample's hash follows from how this project hashes audio, an annotation keyed on the hash
alone would be lost the moment that changes. Every annotation therefore also records an anchor
(`samplecore.anchoring` owns that rule): the module slot it was chosen from — module hash, filename,
instrument index, sample slot, and the occurrence's name — or, for a sample found only in sample
directories, the sample file it was chosen from. `SampleAnnotation.anchor` is the union of the two,
told apart by `kind` in the JSONL a transfer writes, and the table keeps both anchors' columns with a
CHECK holding each row to exactly one of them. `sampleripper annotations relink` reads each anchor
back to recover whatever sample sits there now. The annotation is stored per sample even when it was
applied to a whole equivalence class at once, since a class is identified by a content hash over its
members and gains a different identity the moment its membership changes; `source` records which
gesture applied it, so a decision made about one sample stays distinguishable from one inherited
from its near-duplicates. A group member the catalog holds neither an occurrence nor a file of has nowhere to anchor,
so the gesture removes its annotation rather than leaving it saying what the group no longer says.

The samples listing reads these rows in its own query, joining `curation.sample_annotation` on the
sample hash, which is that table's primary key — so the join cannot fan out and `count` stays
consistent with the page it describes. `favorites_only` and `minimum_rating` therefore narrow the
whole catalog rather than one loaded window, which is what makes a collection scattered across a
hundred thousand samples browsable as a collection. Since every listing request now reaches that
schema, the catalog's owner prepares it before any API serves the catalog -- `sampleripper setup
database`, any pipeline run, or the SampleRipper app opening its library -- since the roles the API
connects as may create nothing.

Every one of these decisions is made where a sample is met: the samples listing edits the label
behind a sample's category, a rating and a favorite mark in the row itself, and the detail panel
offers the same three. A wording is recorded on Enter or on leaving the field, and emptying the
field takes the hand label back so what the listening model heard shows again -- one gesture to
correct a wrong category and one to undo it.
An edit reaches exactly what the row it was made in stands for: the whole equivalence class while
the listing groups near-duplicates together, and the one sample otherwise. `useAnnotationWriter` is
the single path all of them write through, so every row, badge and panel showing that sample follows
one write at once.

Every change to an annotation is kept in `curation.annotation_history`, whichever process makes
it: a row trigger on `sample_annotation` records the operation, the whole row before and after as
JSONB, the transaction's moment and the login role. The trigger's function runs with its owner's
rights (`SECURITY DEFINER`, with a pinned search path), so a role allowed to write annotations
needs, and holds, no privilege on the history, and cannot edit or erase it. The history begins
the moment its table is created, recorded in `curation.annotation_history_start`, with a baseline
entry for every annotation standing then, so every moment from then on can be restored to, the
moments before a library's first label included.
`sampleripper annotations history` lists the latest entries, and `annotations restore --at
<moment>` brings every annotation back to how it stood at that moment, a dry run until `--confirm`:
it writes whole rows back from the history, anchors included, through the table, so the history
records the restore too and restoring to the moment before it undoes it. A moment before the
history begins is refused.

`sampleripper annotations export` writes every annotation to JSONL as the copy that outlives the
database, and `import` merges a file back without clearing anything, in one transaction under the
same lock; a file naming one sample on two lines is refused whole, naming the lines. `relink` leaves
an annotation alone when the sample now in its slot carries a decision of its own, and names it.
Every import records the file it read in `curation.annotation_import`, named by the SHA-256 of its
bytes with the count it held, in the transaction that lands the annotations, so whether a library
already took in a given file is one lookup, wherever that file sits now.

Local, machine-specific configuration (the module source directory, the library root, the catalog's
connection URL) is read from a gitignored `config.toml` via `samplecore.config.load_config`, never
hardcoded into source; the connection URL can also be supplied via the `SAMPLERIPPER_DATABASE_URL`
environment variable (taking precedence over the config file), so credentials need not live in a
file at all. A command given `--config` reads the database from that file alone. `config.example.toml`
documents the expected shape and names no password: it writes `<password>` in each database URL,
`sampleripper setup config` puts a new password of its own in each one as it writes `config.toml`,
readable by its owner alone, and a config still carrying `<password>` is refused. No file this
repository publishes names a password anything can log in with.

A repository that recomputes a whole table's contents from scratch every run -- the cloud
coordinate, module coordinate, and spectral feature repositories, whenever a fresh embedding pass
replaces every row -- exposes `replace_all` alongside its per-row `upsert`: clear the table, then
bulk-load every row through `samplecore.storage.database.bulk_insert`, never a loop of individual
upserts. Parameterized per-row inserts (`executemany`, one large multi-row `VALUES` statement) were
measured at the same few-milliseconds-per-row cost regardless of batch size under this project's
previous engine, turning tens of thousands of rows into minutes; `bulk_insert` reaches past
SQLAlchemy's `Connection` for the underlying `psycopg` connection and streams rows through
Postgres's own `COPY ... FROM STDIN`, avoiding that per-row cost entirely without assuming the
client and server share a filesystem the way a file-path-based `COPY` would.

## The three databases

One Postgres server carries three: the real library, `sampleripper_dev` for the disposable
sandbox, and `sampleripper_test` for the suite. `scripts/build_dev_library.py` builds the sandbox from
`sampleripper.sandbox`, which the suite reads the same modules and sample pack from,
together with a config naming `sampleripper_dev` on the server, role and password of the configured
library (`provisioning.development_database_url`), and an inference address of its own, so the
sandbox's API never dials the real library's renderer. One role, named by `config.toml`'s `database_url`, owns all
three.

Two more roles serve the catalog over HTTP (`samplecore.storage.service_roles`), each with no power
over the server and owning nothing. The reader, named by `server_database_url`, is what `sampleripper
serve` and a deployed site connect as: it reads every catalog table and the labels, and writes
nothing. The curator, named by `curation_database_url`, is what the SampleRipper app's catalog
connects as: it also inserts, updates and deletes rows of `curation.sample_annotation` and adds tag
ranks, and holds nothing on the label history, which its trigger writes with the owner's rights.
`grant_service_role` grants exactly that, idempotently, and `check_service_role` logs in as a role and
insists on it: no superuser or other power, no membership in another role (the predefined ones, such
as `pg_read_server_files`, included), no ownership, no `CREATE`, no temporary tables, every table
the API reads readable, and exactly its service's writes, naming each difference. Postgres lets every
role connect to a new database and create temporary tables in it, so granting takes both from
`PUBLIC` and grants each service role the connection alone. A library keeping its own
server creates `sampleripper_reader` and `sampleripper_curator` itself on every start, with
passwords in `library_root/postgres/roles.json`; the cluster's folder, `roles.json` and `cluster.json`
are readable by their owner alone from the moment they are written.

Every password this project gives a role travels as its SCRAM-SHA-256 verifier
(`samplecore.storage.cluster.scram`, prepared with SASLprep the way libpq prepares it), which
Postgres stores as it is: the role logs in with the password, while the statement setting it, a
server log recording that statement, and the statement `setup database` prints for a person to run
carry only what the server keeps.

`sampleripper setup database` (`just database`) creates whichever of the roles and the databases
are missing and adds any missing tables to the library and the sandbox, leaving every row in place,
so it is safe against a populated library. It grants each service role its rights in both, then
logs in as it to confirm its password and its rights. `samplecore.storage.cluster`
owns that work: `quoting` turns a name or a password into a fragment of SQL and rejects what quoting
cannot carry (an empty identifier, or a NUL byte, which the driver would otherwise cut a name
short at), `statements` holds every statement this project runs against the cluster rather than
inside one database, and `provisioning` decides what to ask for. `CREATE ROLE` needs a superuser,
which `SAMPLERIPPER_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` supplies where the library's own credentials cannot;
without it the command reports the statement to run by hand.

Which database a run reaches is `database_url`, overridden by `SAMPLERIPPER_DATABASE_URL`, which
is how a deployment supplies credentials that never live in a file; the service roles' URLs follow
`SAMPLERIPPER_SERVER_DATABASE_URL` and `SAMPLERIPPER_CURATION_DATABASE_URL` the same way. `--config` wins over both: the
`dev` recipes pass the sandbox's config, and the file's database is the one they reach whatever the
environment holds. The suite reads `SAMPLERIPPER_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, then the server the
configuration names under the `sampleripper_test` database, then `sampleripper_test` on localhost,
and gives each `pytest -n` worker a database of its own, created and dropped around the run: that is
what the role's `CREATEDB` grant is for, and why `sampleripper_test` itself stays empty. The tests of
the service roles create them in a library's own server, whose owner is a superuser, so the shared
test server needs no right to create roles.

## Samples read in place

`sample_directories` in `config.toml` names folders of plain audio files, and
`sampleripper files` catalogs every WAV, AIFF and FLAC file inside them without copying a byte:
`sample_file` holds one row per file, keyed by the configured directory and the file's forward-slash
path inside it, naming the sample the file decodes to, the rate the file declares, and the file's
size and write time. `sample_exclusions` lists shell patterns matched without regard to case against
each path relative to its directory, and an excluded folder is left unwalked; dot-prefixed names,
such as the resource forks macOS leaves beside a file, stay out as well. The directories are
absolute and stand apart from one another, so a file has exactly one row.

A file decodes into the catalog's own form (`samplecore.sample_files.decoding`): 8-bit files stay 8
bits and every deeper or floating-point encoding is quantized to 16, mono and stereo alike, and the
hash is `compute_sample_hash` over those quantized frames, so a file byte-identical to a module's
sample lands on the same `sample` row. The formats read are lossless, which gives one file one hash
for as long as its bytes stay the same. A scan writes the sample, its thumbnail and the file row in
one transaction, in the order every scan takes them, and passes over a file whose size and write time
match its row without reading it, so a repeat scan costs a status call and a lookup per file.

The audio of such a sample lives only in its file, which can be deleted, rewritten or on a drive
that is no longer mounted. `SampleAudio` is the reader every pass and the API share: a sample with a
stored object is read from the store, and otherwise from the first of its files in location order
whose size and write time still match and which still decodes to the sample's hash. A sample none of
whose files qualifies raises `SampleUnavailableError`, which each pass catches around the read alone
and counts: thumbnails, equivalence detection (at fingerprinting, and for a pair whose file vanishes
while the pass runs), feature extraction (the sample stays pending), transposition probes, the
reproducibility probe of a resumed experiment (which compares the first samples it can read), and
the descriptor's training sets. A grid cache or a training run sized to its samples first keeps the
samples `readable_samples` finds, and a file vanishing mid-build stops that build with the previous
cache left in place. A grid cache build writes its rows into its partial and checkpoints them every
ten seconds and on the way out (`samplecore/storage/staged_rows.py`), so a build of the same samples
on the same recipe that was interrupted, killed or cut off continues after its last checkpoint. A
missing stored object is a damaged store and still raises
`FileNotFoundError`. The API serves such a sample's audio as the WAV the store would hold for it,
with the same nominal header rate and the same year-long cache lifetime, and answers 404 naming the
file when none can be read; the sample detail lists its files, each with whether it is available now.

Names and rates read files beside occurrences. A file's name without its suffix counts among the
names the waveform is stored under, which the display name is drawn from; and its declared rate
joins the occurrence rates a sample with no note events is played at, which the frontend applies to
the nominal header the way it does for every sample.

## Running extraction in parallel

`sampleripper extract --workers count` spends that many processes on one corpus, defaulting to one
per core up to `MAXIMUM_AUTOMATIC_WORKERS`, and `sampleripper files --workers count` does the same
for the sample directories. `sampleextract.parallel` owns the arrangement for both: the caller walks
the collection once and hands the supervisor the work list, the pass one share runs and the way
summaries combine; `divide` splits the sorted discovery into one share per worker by taking every
`count`-th item -- striding rather than slicing into blocks, since paths sorted by name group a
directory's similar files together and contiguous blocks would hand one worker all the large ones --
and each worker covers its share in a process of its own, opening its own catalog connection.
Progress crosses back on a queue so the supervisor draws one bar over the whole work list, and the
workers' summaries fold into one through `ExtractionSummary.combine` or
`SampleFileScanSummary.combine`.

Parsing is where the time goes, and it is ordinary Python, so shares want separate processes rather
than threads. Peak memory bounds how many: one module can materialize tens of thousands of note
events, and each worker carries that alone, which is what the ceiling on the automatic count is
for. The pool names `spawn` rather than taking the platform's default start method, so the promise
that no catalog connection is open when a worker starts holds wherever the run happens.

Four things make concurrent workers safe. `audio_store.write` stages its bytes in a temporary file
beside the destination and moves them into place in one step, so two workers reaching the same
sample hash -- routine, since one sample recurs across many modules -- each write a whole object
rather than interleaving into one. `create_schema` takes a Postgres advisory lock, so workers
opening the same fresh catalog at once create its tables in turn instead of racing on `CREATE TABLE
IF NOT EXISTS`. A module two workers reach at the same moment, which this corpus invites by holding
hundreds of byte-identical pairs under different names, is settled by the catalog's own uniqueness
on the module hash: the losing worker rolls its whole module back and counts it under
`ingested_elsewhere`.

And `ingest_module` writes the rows two workers can hold in common -- `sample` and
`sample_thumbnail`, both keyed by content hash -- in ascending hash order, ahead of the occurrences
keyed by `module_id` that belong to one worker alone. Ascending hash order is a total order every
worker agrees on, so two transactions holding one pair of samples between them reach those rows in
the same sequence and the second simply waits for the first. Taking them in the order a module's
own slots happen to list them would let two modules holding one pair in opposite orders each hold
what the other wants next, which Postgres resolves by aborting one with `DeadlockDetected` -- a
failure arriving as `OperationalError`, outside the `IntegrityError` a collision is read from, with
no retry anywhere in this project to fall back on.

## Removing what the collection no longer holds

Extraction adds and never removes, so a module deleted from the collection stays cataloged until
`sampleripper extract --prune` removes it. The pass decides what is gone from what the run itself
read (`sampleextract.prune`): every module file it opened, those it failed to parse included, stays.
It refuses whenever that reading could be incomplete — a worker failed, a file or a folder could not
be read, or the collection yielded no file while modules are cataloged, as an unmounted drive does —
and while another extraction, scan or notes pass holds the extraction lock in shared mode.
`samplecore.storage.prune` then deletes, in one transaction, every row naming a gone module and every
sample neither a module occurrence nor a sample file holds (`SAMPLE_HOLDER_TABLES`), with each table
reaching either, and afterwards unlinks those samples' objects and sweeps any object the catalog does
not name.

`sampleripper files --prune` does the same for sample files (`sampleextract.files.prune`). A file is
gone when the scan found it nowhere: deleted, named by an exclusion now, or under a directory the
configuration no longer lists, since the configuration declares the collection. The prune refuses
on the same incomplete readings, on a configured directory that is missing, and on a configured
directory that yielded no file while files under it are cataloged, which is what the empty mount
point of an unplugged drive looks like. Hand annotations stay;
`annotations relink` reattaches the ones whose slot now holds another sample.

## Detecting near-duplicates

`sampleripper equivalence` finds pairs of samples that are one sound stored twice: at another bit
depth, at another level, or read at another rate. It trims each waveform's trailing silence and
reduces it to two short fingerprints (`sampleextract.equivalence.fingerprint`): one over bands
relative to the waveform's own length, which a change of depth or level leaves alone, and one over
cycle-count octave bands, which a resampling leaves alone. A fingerprint depends on the sample's
audio alone, so it is read once, over `--workers` processes (`samplecore.process_pool`), and kept in
`sample_fingerprint` under the version of the rule that read it (`FINGERPRINT_VERSION`); a pass reads
only the fingerprints the catalog lacks, committing them a thousand at a time. A blockwise dot
product finds each fingerprint's close neighbors (`candidates.py`), the shape fingerprint proposing
gain pairs of nearly equal trimmed length and the rate fingerprint proposing resampled pairs further
apart, and only those pairs are read again and scored on the waveforms themselves (`scoring.py`),
by the same worker processes, each through a cache that keeps its most recently read waveforms,
while the pass searches the next block. The search runs from the samples not yet compared under the
current `COMPARISON_VERSION` against every sample before them, so a pair of two compared samples is
never scored again; each block's relations are written in one transaction with its samples' mark of
having been compared (`compared_version`). An interrupted run therefore keeps the blocks it finished
and a rerun takes up the rest, a catalog that grew compares only its new samples, and `--force`
compares every sample again from the kept fingerprints. A sample one of whose pairs could not be read
stays unmarked for a later pass. Silent samples take no part. Scoring a resampled pair reuses the
low-pass filter `resample_poly` would design, designed once per ratio. Over a catalog of 137,069
samples, one process took two hours to score its 8.5 million candidate pairs.

`pass_completion` holds one row per kind of whole-library pass that finished completely, naming a
digest of what it had in front of it (`samplecore.digests`), so a pass finding the same digest again
ends with nothing to do. `extract --prune` records a digest of every module file's path, size and
write time once its prune succeeded and a second listing finds the collection unchanged, since only a
pruned pass leaves a catalog mirroring the collection; `notes` records the cataloged modules it read
every file of; `equivalence` records the samples that can be read as far as a status call tells
(`readable_sample_hashes`: every sample a module holds, and every sample file standing with its
scanned size and write time), taken before and after its pass, unless the two differ or the pass was
limited to a slice. A pass that goes ahead drops its record first, so an interrupted pass leaves none,
and `--force` goes ahead whatever the record says. The records live in the catalog, so a reset forgets
them along with the rows they describe.

## Building the library in one command

`sampleripper pipeline run [TARGET…]` (`sampleripper.pipeline`) builds the library through its
steps, one at a time and each in a process of its own: the catalog passes (`labels`, `modules`,
`sample-files`, `notes`, `thumbnails`, `equivalence`, `relink`), the listening model's two readings
and its categories (`teacher`, `hearing-teacher`, `categories`), the descriptor from its grid cache
to the cloud (`grid-cache`, `descriptor`, `embedding`, `completion`, `evaluation`,
`module-evaluation`, `cloud`, `module-cloud`). The targets `catalog`, `cloud` and `all` name groups of them,
and a run takes every step its targets need, in the order `steps/library.py` declares them.

**A step decides from what exists.** Progress lives with the outputs themselves. Just before it
would run, a step reads its inputs as named components -- the readable samples, the label texts, an upstream
artifact's content, its parameters -- and is satisfied when an output exists for exactly those
inputs (`steps/kinds.py`):

| Kind | Satisfied when |
|---|---|
| `PassStep` | always runs, its command skipping the work it already finished (`pass_completion`) |
| `GuardedPassStep` | the labels file's digest is recorded in `curation.annotation_import`; it refuses over labels of the library's own |
| `GrowingExperimentStep` | its key names an experiment and no readable sample is left for it to describe |
| `DerivedExperimentStep` | an experiment is filed under the key its inputs' digest names, holds everything its inputs name, and is shown where it must be |
| `FileArtifactStep` | the artifact named by its inputs' digest stands complete with a sidecar recording those inputs |
| `PointerStep` | the library's record (the cloud's promotion, the published models) names this run's output |

A file artifact's sidecar (`<artifact>.pipeline.json`) holds the inputs, the content digest and the
file's fingerprint; an artifact complete by its own marker whose sidecar is missing is sealed
without a rerun. A training artifact is complete once `finished.json` stands beside its model, and a
run of the same inputs that stopped short continues with `--resume`. A build that keeps its progress
beside its artifact, in the hidden `.<artifact>.partial` directory (`samplecore/storage/staging.py`),
continues from it when the same inputs build again; the step names every partial its builds leave,
and a run for new inputs removes the ones older inputs left before its command starts, as a redo
removes the current one and a run from scratch removes them all. A pass reports how much of its work
a stopped pass had finished (`resumed` in its progress report), so the application estimates the
time left from the pace of the work this pass does itself. The descriptor is also sealed
under its content (`descriptor-<sha16>.pt`), which the learned experiment names, so an experiment
always loads the weights it was described by. Downstream inputs read upstream content, so a rerun
producing the same bytes leaves everything after it satisfied. Parameters digest over the validated
values of a step's settings model (`settings.py`), so a default written out, `40.0` for `40` and
reordered keys name the same outputs, and the digest reads the parameters alone, apart from the
ceiling, the device and the worker count.
`descriptor_source` is `automatic` by default, which reading the settings settles: `pretrained`
where the version carries a published release record, `trained` otherwise.
`descriptor_source = "pretrained"` builds the graph without the steps only training reads (the
`teacher` reading and both evaluations): the `descriptor` step then downloads the published
descriptor into the library (`descriptor adopt`), keeping it only when its bytes match the digest
its release records, and the grid cache takes the model's axis from that release and keeps no
retuned views. The release record, `sampledescriptor/pretrained.toml`, is committed with the code:
it names the download URL, the digest and the grid, so planning a build needs no download.
`just release-descriptor <tag>` writes it and the file to upload to that GitHub release, from a
library's current descriptor. A graph naming `pretrained` on a version without a record marks the
steps that read it unavailable (`StepGraph.unavailable`), so a run needing them refuses before its
first step, and a catalog run goes ahead.
`pipeline status` evaluates the same decisions without running anything, naming the components that
moved since a step's last record under `pipeline/steps`.

**Runs stop and resume.** The first step that fails, refuses, is interrupted or outgrows its ceiling
ends the run, every later step is recorded as unreached, and the command exits with that step's
status (1, 3, 130 or 4); a relaunch takes up there. A run holds a session advisory lock per library,
and every step's process holds a lock named for its step (`SAMPLERIPPER_STEP_LOCK`), so a second run,
or a relaunch while an orphaned step still runs, is refused. A step runs in a session of its own
under its memory scope; the run passes Ctrl+C on to it once, terminates it on the second and kills
it on the third. Each run keeps `pipeline/runs/<time>-<id>/`: `events.jsonl`, `attempts.jsonl`, a
log per step and the configuration snapshot every step reads, so an edit made while a run goes on
reaches the next run. Every durable effect is made before the event reporting it, and the scheduler
holds no `finally` or exit that writes (`test_forward_only.py`), which is what makes a killed run
equal to one stopped at the same moment.

`--from-scratch` records its intent, resets the catalog, removes every output the steps own, and
removes the intent; a relaunch finding the intent finishes the removal first. `--redo STEP` drops a
file step's artifact, sidecar and training run, keeping its sealed copy.

**Scenarios prove it.** `tests/sampleripper/pipeline/scenarios` runs the pipeline through its own
composition root (`run_pipeline_command`) in a process of its own over a small world of modules and
sample files. A scenario states, act by act, the verdict of every step, how the run ended, and which
parts of the catalog and the artifacts moved; every act is also held to the evidence the run left
(attempts, logs, the scripted steps' ledger), to what `status` said right before it, to a settled
status after it, and to no lock outliving it. Catalog passes run their real commands; the steps
reading the listening model or training a network run their real command lines against stand-ins
that write the real outputs (`harness/stand_ins.py`). Faults script a step's exit, a gate stops it
before, partway through or after its output for the scenario to interrupt or kill it, and a sink
kills the run's own process at a chosen event. `just test-pipeline` runs the same stories with every
real program on the processor, and `just explore-pipeline` draws sequences of acts with Hypothesis
(`test_exploration.py`) and holds every run to the same checks, shrinking a divergence to the
shortest sequence showing it.

## The application

`sampleripper app` (`sampleripper.app`) is what a person without a terminal runs. One uvicorn
process serves one ASGI app: the setup routes under `/api/setup`, the catalog API behind them, and
the built frontend. The `Launcher` owns what the library needs:

- **Config.** Outside a checkout the config file lives in the user's settings folder
  (`platformdirs`), and the setup routes write it through `samplecore.config_editing`, which
  validates the new content the way `load_config` reads it before replacing the file. A config the
  application creates names no `database_url` and takes the pretrained descriptor. The file stays
  as it is while a build runs.
- **Database.** A config naming no `database_url` manages its own Postgres
  (`samplecore.storage.cluster.embedded`): `initdb` and `pg_ctl` from the `postgresql-binaries`
  wheel create and run a cluster in `library_root/postgres`, listening on the loopback address
  under one owner role, with the port and password in `cluster.json`, and the two service roles'
  passwords in `roles.json`. Every process reaches it through `LibraryConfig.catalog_url()`, and a
  served API through `LibraryConfig.service_url()`, which read those files; a port another program
  has taken moves to a free one on the next start. A server the application finds running on another
  installation's programs, as the server of an installation since removed keeps running, is
  restarted on its own programs as it opens the library: a running server loads parts of itself,
  such as its procedural language, from its program folder as it needs them.
- **Catalog API.** Once the config validates and the database answers, the launcher builds
  `sampleserver.app.create_app` in process and runs its lifespan; `CatalogRoute` forwards every
  `/api` path outside the setup routes to it, and answers 503 while the library is closed.
- **Renderer and builds.** `morph serve` runs as a child process, on the configured `[inference]`
  address or, when another program holds that port, on a free one of the same host
  (`samplecore.ports`), which the catalog API then dials. A build runs `sampleripper
  pipeline run catalog|all` as a child process, and `sampleripper.app.jobs` reads the run's
  `events.jsonl` and the progress file each step's pass writes (`samplecore.progress`, named by
  `SAMPLERIPPER_PROGRESS_FILE`). A step's times come from its attempt's events, and a pass's
  report carries the moment the pass started, from which the setup page estimates the time it has
  left.
- **The person at this computer.** The app lists folders, writes the config file and records
  labels, so it answers the person at this computer on every path: a request from the loopback
  address, addressed to a local name, sent by a page from a local name when a page sent it, sent by
  no page on another site but as a followed link, and forwarded by no proxy
  (`sampleserver.local_person.LocalPersonOrHomeDevices`). The name is read from the `Host` header
  exactly as sent (`samplecore.host_header`), since Starlette's own reading of a name it cannot
  parse falls back to the address the server listens on: a page elsewhere that renames its own
  host to reach this one, whatever characters its name holds, still names that host, and is
  refused. Rewriting the config file keeps it readable by its owner alone.
- **Devices at home.** The setup page's **Open on my home network** switch writes `exposure =
  "network"` or `"local"` (`samplecore.config_editing.LibraryOptions`), which the application
  reads as it starts (`sampleripper.app.listener.starting_policy`); a config it cannot read, or
  one serving the library to anyone, starts it on this computer alone. Opened, it listens on every
  address, and the devices the policy admits reach every path but the setup routes; label writes
  still ask for the person at this computer (`require_local_person`), and at most two morphs render
  at once. The setup page shows the address a device opens, this computer's address on its home
  network with the port, and asks for a restart while the switch differs from the run.
- **Starts.** One application runs under each config (`sampleripper.app.instance`). Its place
  is a folder in the user's state folder named by a hash of the config's path, holding a lock the
  process keeps for its whole life and a record of the port it listens on and of the process
  itself, its id and start time. The system lets a lock go however its process ends, so a free lock
  means nothing runs. A start holding a taken lock reads the record and asks the server
  `GET /api/setup/installation`, which names its version and Python environment:
  - The same installation gets the browser opened on it.
  - Another one, a new version or the other launcher, is asked to quit through `POST
    /api/setup/quit`, which answers once the build, the renderer and the managed database have
    stopped.
  - A server that refuses connections is on its way out, and gets the time a quit takes.
  - A server that takes a connection without answering for 20 seconds, or never ends after a
    quit, is ended together with the processes it started (psutil), once its start time confirms
    the record's process. A record naming no running process ends nothing, and the start is
    refused.

  The start then binds its own socket before anything else runs and records it: first the port
  the record names, which keeps the browser's layout, theme and cache, all stored per address, then
  27440 to 27449, then any port the system assigns, or exactly the port `--port` names. The server
  listens on 127.0.0.1, or on every address once opened to the home network, and reads no
  forwarding headers. `--quit` ends the running one the same
  way and starts nothing.
- **One application per library.** The launcher holds a second lock, in the instances folder's
  `libraries/`, named by a hash of the library root, from the moment it opens a library until the
  library's managed database has stopped. An application under another config naming the same
  library, such as a checkout's beside the installed one, shows it as failed, so the one quitting
  never stops the database under the other.

The packaged application is a PyApp executable (`just package`, `just executable`): it embeds the
sampleripper wheel, which carries the built frontend, with the `app` extra pinned to the lock and
torch's processor build. The wheel, its pinned requirements and the frontend bundle are built into
`build/`, the executable into `bin/`, and the installers into `dist/`. On first start it installs Python and that wheel with uv. PyApp runs it as
a GUI, in a process of its own: on Windows through pythonw, windowless, with its output in
`app-<config hash>.log` in the user's log folder (`sampleripper.app.console`), and every console program it starts, such
as `pg_ctl`, starts hidden (`samplecore.processes`). `just installer` (`scripts/installers`,
`packaging/`) wraps the executable into an Inno Setup installer, a disk image holding an app bundle,
or an AppImage. The
Application workflow builds all three, smoke-testing each executable on a fresh runner first.

## Who a served library answers

`[server] exposure` in the config decides it, and nothing else does (`samplecore.config.Exposure`):

| | `local` (the default) | `network` | `public` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Listens on | 127.0.0.1 alone | every address | every address, `sampleripper site` alone |
| Answers | the loopback address, naming the server by a local name | also devices on the home network's own ranges (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16, fc00::/7, fe80::/10, an IPv4 address inside IPv6 unwrapped), naming it by an address or this computer's name | anyone |
| Sample file folders | full path, and whether the file is there | full path, and whether the file is there | the folder's name, no file state |
| Labels, ratings, favorites | shown | shown | not served: null fields, the routes reading them answer 404, a listing narrowed or ordered by them 422 |
| A relation's reviewer | named | named | left out |
| A stored object | served by its hash | served by its hash | served for a cataloged sample alone |
| A refusal | names the file or the renderer's address | names the file or the renderer's address | plain words; the details go to the log |
| API docs | served | served | none |
| Morphs rendering at once | any number | two | `[server.visitors] concurrent_morphs` |

`sampleserver.policy.ServingPolicy` derives every row from the exposure alone, and every route,
middleware and command that behaves differently reads one of its properties; a test holds every
other source file to naming no exposure. `AdmittedRequestsOnly` answers each request `admits`
accepts, which is how a page elsewhere that points its own name at the loopback address is turned
away under `local`, and a request a page sent passes `admits_page` too: at home, the page comes
from the server itself or from a local name, and a page on another site open in the same browser
is turned away, also where it sends no `Origin`, as an image or audio element does, since the
browser names it in `Sec-Fetch-Site`; only a link followed from it opens a page. Nothing a request carries selects the exposure: its address, the name it gives
the server and its headers can only turn it away. The page asks `GET /api/curation/access`, which
answers what it may show and change (`curation_shown`, `label_editing`), and shows no control for a
decision the server holds back. A served app opens a sample's file only in the sample directories
its own configuration lists, whatever folder the catalog it serves names. `sampleripper serve` binds
only where the exposure listens and refuses `public`, which `sampleripper site` serves, and the
SampleRipper app refuses `public` before it opens a library.

### Publishing a library

`sampleripper publish` (`sampleripper.publish`) puts a library on a site: its catalog in the site's
database, and its audio in `library_root/publication/objects`, a folder laid out as the store is, to
upload. The database comes from `SAMPLERIPPER_PUBLISH_DATABASE_URL` and the reader's password from
`SAMPLERIPPER_PUBLISH_READER_PASSWORD`, the environment alone. A plain `postgresql://` URL is read
through psycopg, and a server other than this computer is reached with `sslmode=require` and
`channel_binding=require`: SCRAM binds the password to the TLS handshake, so a platform's proxy
presenting a certificate no authority signed cannot stand between the two unnoticed.

Everything is read from one `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot of the library's catalog:

1. **The samples.** Every sample a module holds, and every sample found in a directory named under
   `[publish] sample_directories`; a sample found only elsewhere, a commercial pack's say, stays
   home. The categories on show must have been scored with the shipped vocabulary, whose wording is
   no one's own.
2. **The audio.** Each sample a module holds is linked from the store, a missing object stopping
   the publication as a damaged store; a file-only sample is written as the store would hold it, or
   left out when none of its files still reads as scanned. Anything else in the folder goes.
3. **The catalog.** One transaction on the target: the schema, the reader created or given the new
   password (as its verifier) and granted what it reads, every table emptied, then each table's
   published rows streamed by `COPY` from the snapshot. `sampleripper.publish.rules` gives every
   table of the catalog and the curation schema one rule, and a test holds the rules to exactly the
   tables there are, so a table added later is published only once someone decided which of its
   rows go:
   - whole: the module collection (`module`, the sample properties, `note_event`,
     `module_cloud_coordinates`, `module_link`) and `category_promotion`;
   - the published samples' rows: `sample`, their coordinates, spectral features, thumbnails and
     playback rates;
   - `sample_file`: the published directories' files, each directory written as `/` and its
     folder's name;
   - `sample_relation`: the relations joining two published samples, with no review;
   - `sample_category`: the published samples' categories in the scoring on show;
   - `experiment`: the scoring on show alone, with its parameters cut to the vocabulary and no label
     or key;
   - none: every curation table, fingerprints, feature vectors, `cloud_promotion`,
     `pass_completion`, `module_instrument`, `module_note_extraction`.

   Before the commit, every curation table must be empty, and no text or JSON column may name the
   library root, the module directory, a sample directory or the home folder; either rolls the
   whole transaction back, naming the table and column. A `publication.record` row, in a schema of
   its own, marks the database as a publication's. A database holding a catalog without it is
   someone's library and is refused before anything in it changes, so a publication pointed at the
   library itself empties nothing.
4. **The reader.** Logged in as over the same address, and checked the way a site checks it.

A publication replaces the whole catalog while the site's reads wait at most 60 seconds for it
(`lock_timeout`). The site then restarts to read it, which also names its cached answers anew.

### The site

`sampleripper site` (`sampleripper.site`) serves a library to anyone: the catalog's API and pages
through the same app `serve` builds, and the morph renderer beside them in one container. Before
anything starts it refuses, each in a sentence of its own (`sampleripper.site.admission`):

- an exposure other than `public`;
- a missing or malformed `$PORT`, which a hosting platform names;
- an owner, curator, administrator or publishing connection, from the config or the environment;
- a reader named nowhere, or with a password shorter than 24 characters;
- a renderer listening beyond the loopback address, or on the site's own port;
- an audio store it cannot read.

It then checks the reader's role the way `serve` does. A store that is missing or empty is a
warning as the site starts, since a platform's volume is filled through the running site: the
site serves its catalog, every sample answers "not found" and `GET /api/health` reports
`audio_present` false until the objects arrive, which the site reads with no restart. The renderer starts as a child with no
database connection in its environment and one thread per numerical library, its output joining the
site's, and the site serves once the renderer answers. A renderer that ends while the site serves
ends the site with status 1, so the platform starts both again.

`[server.visitors]` limits a library served to anyone, and no other exposure takes it
(`sampleserver.visitors`). A visitor is the address the platform's edge names in
`address_header` (Railway sets `X-Real-IP` itself, overwriting whatever a client sent), an IPv6
address counting by its /64, and the socket's peer where the header names none. Each visitor holds
a token budget of `burst` requests refilled at `refill_per_second`, a whole-catalog answer costing
`whole_catalog_weight` and the health check nothing; a request past it is answered 429 with
`Retry-After`. At most `concurrent_morphs` morphs reach the renderer at once, one past them
answered 503 before any budget is spent. A new render spends one of the visitor's
`morphs_per_minute` and one of everyone's `morphs_per_minute_overall` before the renderer is asked.
A request naming a render the browser holds, which the renderer confirms with a 304 at no cost, is
asked while neither budget is in debt, and spends one once the renderer answers with new audio, so
a validator the renderer never issued buys a visitor one render past the budget at most, one per
render in flight. The budgets live in the server's process, bounded to the most
recently active visitors, so a site runs one process (`WEB_CONCURRENCY=1`), which also keeps one
copy of the spectral matrix and matches the renderer's one render at a time. The cached answers
over the whole catalog carry an ETag, named apart per process, so a returning visitor is answered
304 until the catalog moves or the site restarts. The page fetches a morph before playing it, so a
refusal shows the server's own words, and a hovered point asks for its glance once the cursor
rests on it for 120 ms.

## Who may change what

| Process | Connects as | May write |
|---|---|---|
| `sampleripper serve`, `sampleripper site` and its image | the reader, `server_database_url` | nothing |
| the SampleRipper app's catalog API | the curator, `curation_database_url` | `curation.sample_annotation`, one sample or one group of near-duplicates per request, and new tag ranks |
| the pipeline, every other command, `setup`, the app preparing its own database | the owner, `database_url` | everything |

- **Postgres enforces the table.** Each service role holds exactly its service's rights, and a
  start whose role holds more is refused: `sampleripper serve` before any worker runs, the
  SampleRipper app before it opens the library. No request clears or truncates a table: the API
  offers no such route, and the curator holds no `TRUNCATE`.
- **Label writes exist only in the SampleRipper app,** which takes them from the person at its
  computer alone: a label write comes from the loopback address, addresses the app by a local
  name, was sent by a page from a local name when a page sent it, and passed no proxy. The app
  listens on 127.0.0.1, or on every address once opened to the home network, where other devices
  look and change nothing, and reads no forwarding headers. A served reader, a deployed site among
  them, declares no route that writes, which a sweep of every path and writing method holds.
- **Every label change can be undone.** The history's trigger records every change whichever role
  makes it, and neither service role can read, edit or erase the history. `sampleripper
  annotations restore --at <moment>` brings the labels back to any moment since the history began.
- **What this leaves open:**
  - The SampleRipper app's own process holds the owner's rights, since it prepares its database and
    runs its builds, so the curator role confines the app's HTTP routes, not code running in that
    process.
  - A reverse proxy on the same computer that adds no forwarding header looks like a browser there.
    Publish `sampleripper serve`, never the SampleRipper app.
  - A page served from another port of the same computer passes the Origin check.
  - Any program or user on this computer counts as its person: the loopback address carries no
    user.
  - The morph renderer opens no database. It listens on the loopback address unless told otherwise,
    and renders whatever a program calling its address asks; it answers no web page
    (`samplemorph.service.callers`), since a browser sends `Sec-Fetch-Site` with every request and
    an `Origin` with a page's requests elsewhere, and a page that points its own name at the
    renderer's address still names itself in its `Host` header. A browser too old to send
    `Sec-Fetch-Site` can still start a render from another site's audio element, and reads nothing
    back.
  - A library opened to the home network shows everything to any device on a network whose
    addresses are private, a café's or an office's as much as a home's; the switch says to use it
    on a trusted network alone, and it stays on as the computer moves between networks. Its pages
    travel unencrypted over that network.
  - A site's request budget counts requests, not the work each asks for: a listing reads every
    relation to group near-duplicates, and a caching of that per catalog revision is still to
    come. One IPv6 /48, which some providers hand out free, holds 65,536 visitors. The site's
    pages and scripts outside the API are served without a budget. The spending limit bounds the
    cost of a flood, which then shows as the site stopping, not as a bill.
  - The visitor a budget belongs to is the address Railway's edge writes into `X-Real-IP`, which a
    deployment is checked for once: a forged `X-Real-IP` splits no budget.
  - On the site's database server, the reader may connect to the databases a publication leaves
    alone, such as `postgres`, and create temporary tables there; this matters only while the
    database is open to the internet to publish and the reader's password is known.
  - The image's base images and uv are pinned by tag, not by digest.
  - Old example passwords stay in the repository's history. A config holding one is still
    accepted by a library at home; a site refuses a reader password shorter than 24 characters.

## Deployment

Two packages run as long-lived services: `sampleserver`, the API, and `samplemorph.service`, the
morph inference process. `sampleextract` and `samplecloud` are one-shot offline batch commands,
run by hand or on a schedule, never by the served app itself. The root `Dockerfile` builds the image
of a site (`sampleripper site`, [The site](#the-site)): a Node stage builds the frontend, and the
Python stages install the `server` and `morph` extras from the lock, so the API and its renderer
share one container while `sampleextract`/`samplecloud`'s heavier dependencies (`umap-learn`,
`scikit-learn`, torch) never reach it. The image runs as an unprivileged user (uid 1000), with the
site's config, `docker/site.toml`, at `/app/config.toml`: `library_root` is `/library`, where the
platform mounts the volume holding the published audio, the renderer listens on the loopback
address, the exposure is `public` and `[server.visitors]` sizes the limits. It holds no credential:
the platform names the reader's connection in `SAMPLERIPPER_SERVER_DATABASE_URL`. Its environment
runs one process (`WEB_CONCURRENCY=1`), and its command is `site --host 0.0.0.0`, on the port
`$PORT` names; the health check reads `/api/health` there. `railway.json` builds the `Dockerfile` on
Railway, checks `/api/health` as a deployment starts, restarts a site that ends with a failure, and
rebuilds only when something the image holds changes. `docs/deploying.md` walks a person through it.

The inference process (`sampleripper morph serve`) installs the `morph` extra alone, reads the library
root and the sample directories its configuration lists, renders under the settings `morph.yaml` in
`samplemorph/routes/selections/` names, as committed the envelope morph whose excitation crossfades both ends and
glides between their read pitches, reads `morph-filter.yaml` beside it for the filters it hands over, and opens no database: a
morph names two samples and a weight, and the API, which knows the catalog, reads each sample's
playback rate the way it does everywhere else, together with the file an end found only in sample
directories is read from — the first still as it was scanned, or a 404 before the process is dialed
when none is. The process reads a named file only inside its own sample directories, and only when
the file decodes to the hash the request names. Both processes read one setting, `[inference] url` in `config.toml`: the
process binds it, the API dials it, and a morph request reaching the API while no process answers
comes back as 503, a render outlasting the client's wait as 504, and any other failure of the
process as 502, each naming the address where the serving policy names internals. Renders are deterministic given what a route reads, so
each carries a validator built from a fingerprint over the route's description, its settings, and `RENDER_REVISION`, together with the point, under `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`: a browser
revalidates every play, and one holding the render is answered with a 304 by the process that made
it. A point whose ends are heard more than sixteen times apart in rate, or that would render past
`MAXIMUM_RENDER_FRAMES`, is refused with 422 before any rendering, and the render and pair caches
are bounded by the bytes they hold.

Beside the audio and the status, a process answers `GET /morph/response`
with the filter between two samples, named by a validator over the pair alone since it holds at
every weight between them, and `POST /morph/response` with the filter between two audio files the
caller uploads, which is how a sampler holding its own audio asks. Uploads are named by a digest of
their bytes, carry at most `MAXIMUM_UPLOAD_BYTES` each, and are heard at the higher of the two rates
their files state. The API relays the audio and the status, which is what a browser plays
and what it asks before offering to; a caller of the filter renders its own audio from it and dials
the process directly, so the filter travels between the two of them alone. The filter is read under
`morph-filter.yaml`, the process's second selection file, which holds every pitch because a filter
holds for a path whose harmonics stand where they stood; one process therefore plays the gliding
morph the renderer serves and hands over the filter beside it, and it reports a filter selection that
glides in one line at startup, before any address is bound. The response cache is bounded by its
bytes the way the others are.

Every route the API serves sits under `/api` (`sampleserver.app.API_PREFIX`), so one path always
names one thing: the frontend reaches `/api/samples` while a person's browser holds `/samples/{hash}`
as a client route of its own. That is what lets the Vite dev server forward a single prefix to the
backend and answer everything else with the application itself, so reloading a sample's own URL
brings back the dashboard. `sampleripper serve --frontend build/frontend` does the same without Vite:
`sampleserver.frontend.SinglePageApplication` serves the built files and answers every other path
outside `/api` with `index.html`, and the image serves its own build this way. It is mounted through
`FrontendMount`, which takes no path under `/api`, so the API answers a wrong method with 405 and
its allowed methods, a trailing slash with its redirect, and an unknown path with its JSON 404,
whether or not a frontend is served beside it.

The dev server also grows the cloud on request: with `VITE_CLOUD_DENSIFY` set, a plugin in
`frontend/dev/` answers `/api/cloud` (and `/api/cloud/modules` under `VITE_CLOUD_DENSIFY_MODULES`)
with the backend's own points followed by seeded clones of them, laid out in Gaussian clusters and
each carrying its parent's hash and rate, so the sandbox's few dozen samples show the density of a
library of a hundred thousand and every interaction still reaches the catalog. A catalog whose
embedding has yet to run is laid out from its own listing first, one cluster per top level its badge
names -- the hand label, else the category, else the first word of its name -- which keeps
every point on a real hash. The plugin runs under `vite` serve alone.

`sampleripper serve` loads the configuration and logs in as the reader role `server_database_url`
names before uvicorn starts, checking it with `check_service_role`. A missing or incomplete config,
a config naming no reader, a role that may change anything, and a catalog nobody has prepared each
end the start with one message and exit status 3, and a database that cannot be reached within ten
seconds with one message and exit status 1. Every worker connects as that reader, and creates
nothing.

`docker-compose.yml` runs the site as a platform does, beside a Postgres of its own, on this
computer alone: a rehearsal of what visitors will see. `just docker-secrets` writes the superuser's
password into `docker/postgres.env` and the reader's connection into `docker/site.env`, each once,
with passwords of their own and readable by their owner alone; compose refuses to start without
them, so no password is written into the compose file or falls back to a known or empty one, and
the site's container is handed the reader's connection alone. `just docker-publish` publishes a
library into that Postgres over the loopback address, reading both passwords from those files, and
the `site` service mounts the publication folder (`PUBLICATION`, by default
`./library/publication`) read-only at `/library` and answers on `127.0.0.1:8000`. A path that is not
there fails the start rather than mounting an empty directory. Local development runs
against a Postgres installed on the machine directly, which the test suite and both library
databases share. A served app runs as one or several worker processes (`WEB_CONCURRENCY`), where `just serve` starts
the one reloading process development uses: each worker holds a small pool of Postgres connections as the
reader, checked out per request (`sampleserver.dependencies.READ_CONNECTION`), which Postgres's
own concurrent-connection handling supports natively, so multiple people browsing the library
through one deployed server works correctly with no shared state between workers. A route and every
dependency it reads through share one connection, which goes back to the pool as the route returns,
before its answer is sent, so a caller reading an answer slowly holds none of the pool. Postgres ends
a served statement after 30 seconds and a transaction left idle after 60
(`samplecore.storage.database.create_pooled_engine`), longer than a whole-catalog read or a cached
answer's rebuild takes. `GET /api/health` answers once the catalog does, at the cost of `SELECT 1`,
for a platform checking the server.

Every response states what a browser may do with it (`sampleserver.headers`): read it as the type it
states (`nosniff`), frame it on no page, and send its address to no other site. The application's
own pages carry a content security policy loading everything from the server itself, beyond three
needs of the built pages: regl compiles its drawing commands with `Function`, wavesurfer writes a
style into a shadow root and plays from a blob URL, and the build inlines its smallest font files as
data URLs. The two typefaces travel with the application (`@fontsource`), so a page loads nothing
from any other site. A library served to anyone also tells browsers to reach it over HTTPS alone.

Three routes answer for the whole catalog at once — the cloud's hundred thousand points, a
nearest-neighbor search, the library statistics — and each is written for that shape rather than
scaled up from a per-sample one. A whole-catalog reader scans a table outright instead of naming
every hash it wants (`names_and_rates_for_every_sample` beside `names_and_rates_by_hash`), since a
hundred thousand bound parameters cost Postgres more than reading every row there is. The statistics
count and total in one grouped query rather than building a model per sample to sum. The spectral
vectors, which are stored as text and take a couple of seconds to parse, are held per application in
`SpectralVectorCache` and re-read only when the table's own revision moves, so a search costs one
cheap query rather than a fresh parse of the whole embedding.

Postgres supports genuine concurrent readers *and* writers against the same database, unlike this
project's previous engine (DuckDB), which excluded every other connection -- read-only included --
while one process held a write transaction open. A batch job (`sampleripper extract`,
`equivalence`, `thumbnails`, `cloud embed`) can now run alongside `sampleserver` serving live
traffic without that exclusion; the operational concern that remains is a batch job's own resource
footprint on the host machine (CPU contention, not lock contention -- still worth timing a heavy
local run accordingly). `sampleripper cloud embed` in particular writes into its own experiment
(`sample_feature_vector`, scoped by `experiment_id`) and never touches `sample_cloud_coordinates`
until `reduce_and_persist_coordinates`'s own explicit promotion step, so an in-progress extraction
run has no visible effect on what the server or other experiments see until that promotion happens.

### What the cloud costs

Measured on the real catalog of 127,588 samples over localhost on 2026-09-12, one uvicorn worker,
before and after each tier of the network work. The stages script
(`runs/cloud-2026-09-12/measure_stages.py` under the library root) times the server's own work
with no server running; `measure_routes.sh` beside it reads wire bytes and times off a running
`sampleripper serve`; the browser's parse time is `JSON.parse` over the fetched text in the
console.

| Route or event | Before | After the trims | After the cache |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/cloud` wire bytes | 25.1 MB, plain | | |
| `/api/cloud` time to first byte | 2.7 s | | |
| `/api/cloud` server build | 2.7 s (reads 1.5, classification 0.66, models 0.55, serialization 0.23) | 2.1 s (reads 1.0, classification 0.48, models 0.45, serialization 0.17), once per revision after the cache | |
| `/api/cloud/categories` wire bytes and time | 26 MB, 4.0 s | | |
| `/api/cloud/category-tags` time | 2.7 s | | |
| Cloud panel mount, category mode | 6 requests, 53 MB | | |
| Cloud panel reopen | 6 requests again | | |
| A hover | 2 requests, 2 connections, 120 ms | | |
| A replay of one sample | full download again | | |
| Browser parse of `/api/cloud` | 66 ms | | |

The trims: gzip on every response past a kilobyte; the audio route answering from the store with
an immutable cache lifetime and no catalog round trip; the category tags counted in SQL; the
cloud's points without the hand label a viewer never read and with coordinates rounded to four
decimals; the module points without a timestamp each; the categories as each sample's top one
alone; a hover served by one preview route reading the stored thumbnail, drawn at the card's size
and the screen's density; the points cached for
the session in the browser and the label and category sources fetched only in the mode that
paints by them. The classification term in the build belonged to the keyword categories the points
carried then; the points now carry coordinates and rates alone, and the Cloud panel opens painted
by category from the scoring on show, fetching `/api/cloud/categories` and the cached
`/api/cloud/category-tags` as it mounts. Measured on the same body, gzip alone takes the cloud's response to 9 MB and the
trims together to 6.7 MB; a binary columnar layout would reach 5.2 MB, most of it the hashes, and
is worth its own format only if the gzipped body passes 10 MB or the download and parse pass a
second on a real link.

## Sample cloud embeddings

`samplecloud.backends.FeatureExtractor` is a protocol, not a fixed implementation: anything
returning a fixed-length, finite vector for a waveform fits the pipeline, so the extraction method
stays swappable as perceptual results call for a different approach. `LibrosaFeatureExtractor` is
the current implementation, combining a whole-clip timbral summary (MFCC, spectral centroid and
bandwidth, zero-crossing rate, RMS, each aggregated by mean and standard deviation across frames)
with temporal features that keep a sound's shape over time visible in the vector: segment-wise
means across early/mid/late thirds of the clip, a duration-normalized attack-time fraction from
onset detection, and delta-MFCC statistics capturing how fast timbre moves. The projection and the
persisted "spectral distance" both derive directly from this vector's length and composition, so
changing it -- adding, removing, or reweighting a feature group -- changes what similarity means
for the whole library. Because every extraction run is scoped to its own `Experiment`, this no
longer risks mixing incompatible vector shapes the way a single shared cache once did: run the
changed extractor as a new experiment (`sampleripper cloud embed --backend <name>`), inspect and
compare its result, and only promote it (`reduce_and_persist_coordinates` against that experiment's
id) once satisfied -- the previously promoted experiment's `sample_cloud_coordinates` stay exactly
as they were until that deliberate step. `sampleripper cloud embed --backend <name> --extract-only`
runs the extraction alone, for an experiment made to be measured or to teach another descriptor;
`cloud embed --experiment-id N` resumes experiment N and promotes it.

An experiment records its recipe in its parameters (`samplecloud.experiments.EmbeddingRecipe`): the
backend, the `reading`, for a learned descriptor the model's name, and for the listening model the
commit of its checkpoint this build pins (`TEACHER_REVISION`), so an experiment heard through
another commit is refused rather than extended. An experiment may carry a key, unique across the
catalog (`experiment.key`): `cloud embed --key K` starts an experiment under K following the recipe
flags, and every later run naming K resumes it, and `descriptor embed --key K` commits its experiment
first and its vectors five thousand at a time, so a run stopped partway keeps what it wrote and the
next run naming K describes only the cached samples the experiment lacks; the pipeline's `embedding`
step counts an experiment holding fewer vectors than its cache as unfinished. A resumed experiment follows
the recipe its own row records, so `--experiment-id` refuses a `--backend`, `--model` or
`--heard-rate` naming another, and a label, which names a new experiment. Before new vectors join an
experiment that already holds some, its first eight samples by hash are described again and must
point where their stored vectors do (`require_reproducible`), so a descriptor retrained under the
same name is refused rather than mixed in. `--resume-promoted` resumes the experiment `cloud_promotion`
names, opening and recording the default `librosa` experiment on a library with no cloud yet; a
promoting run that adds no vector to the experiment already shown keeps its layout as it is. A layout
needs at least four vectors, the fewest UMAP lays out. A layout keeps its finished stages under
`cache/cloud` in the library root (`samplecloud.stages`), named by the digest of the experiment,
the samples it describes, UMAP's settings and the versions of UMAP and its neighbor search: from
4,096 vectors on, where UMAP searches for neighbors approximately anyway, the neighbor graph is
searched first and kept, then the coordinates are kept once fitted, so a run stopped partway takes
up after the last stage it finished, and the stages go once the layout is written.

The `clap` backend reads a pretrained audio-text model (`samplecloud.backends.teacher_backend`,
behind the `teacher` extra), which knows sound from what people wrote about recordings and, on the
first hand labels, leads both hand-built descriptors by a wide margin. It computes the model's own
log-mel picture on the device, at a quarter of the library extractor's cost. Beside its place in
the cloud it is the teacher the `sampledescriptor` descriptor is distilled from, which is where its one
weakness -- it moves under an octave's retuning -- is repaired.

Every pass reads a sample one of two ways (`samplecloud.hearing`), recorded in the experiment's
parameters as `reading`: at the nominal rate the store writes, the reading every cloud is built
on, or, with `--heard-rate`, at the rate the library plays the sample at, resampled through
`samplecore.waveform.heard_at_rate` so a bass played two octaves below its file's rate reaches the
extractor as a bass. The heard-rate reading is what naming an instrument needs, since the
listening model's rate invariance ends within a whole tone. A vector keeps the rate it was heard at
(`sample_feature_vector.heard_rate`, empty under the nominal reading), so a sample the library comes
to play at another rate -- a new module playing it, or a sample file declaring another rate beside its
occurrences -- is pending again, its vector replaced in the checkpoint that stores the new one, and
the reproducibility probe checks only samples still heard at their vectors' rates.

`sampleripper cloud categorize` turns a `clap` experiment's vectors into categories. The text tower
reads a vocabulary of prompts in the hand-label grammar -- the shipped instrument list, the tags
people wrote, or a file with one label per line -- into the same space, one cosine per sample and
label ranks them, and each sample keeps its closest few under a new experiment of the `zero_shot`
backend, whose parameters name the source experiment, the checkpoint, the prompt template and the
vocabulary in order (`sample_category`, `samplecore.storage.repositories.sample_category`). The
command reports how the top categories spread over the vocabulary and how they agree with the hand
labels, exactly and at the top level. Categories are rebuildable, so they live in the main schema
beside the feature vectors. `category_promotion` names the scoring the application shows, and a
scoring writes its experiment, every category and that record in one transaction, so a reader never
meets one half written. `--key` files a scoring under a name of its own: a later run naming the same key
and the same recipe shows that scoring again without loading the model, and one naming another
recipe is refused.

### Judging a descriptor

`samplecloud.evaluation` scores any experiment's vectors against three targets the catalog already
carries, so a change to an extractor is answered by numbers rather than by an impression.

- **Transposition retrieval** retunes a sample by a fixed mirrored grid of semitone offsets,
  describes the result, and reports where the original ranks against the whole catalog. It needs no
  label at all, since retuning produces a query the catalog holds the answer to. Rank-1 and rank-5
  shares travel beside the median rank, because a descriptor placing the original second every time
  and one placing it forty-thousandth both score zero at rank one.
- **Note-event agreement** predicts how many distinct pitches a sample is played at and how wide a
  span it covers, scored by rank correlation. Both are continuous, because the percussive and tonal
  split they were once read as is a tendency rather than a division. A second reading covers only
  samples struck often enough for a pitch count to mean something, since a sample struck twice shows
  at most two pitches whatever it is.
- **Hand-label agreement** ranks every labeled sample's labeled neighbors and credits each by how
  much its label agrees with the query's, graded along the hierarchy as `samplecore.labeling`
  defines it. NDCG over the nearest ten reads the whole neighborhood, precision at one asks whether
  the nearest shares any tag, and every tag with enough support is scored on its own by average
  precision. The labeled set is small and grows as the person labels, so the NDCG carries a
  bootstrap interval over the queries and every score its chance level. A label depth reads the
  labels to that many levels, for a coarser reading of the same set.

`--scope modules` scores the samples tracker modules hold and leaves the ones found only in sample
directories out, fitting the standardization over that corpus alone, so a descriptor trained with a
sample pack and one trained without it are read over one body of samples; every report carries its
scope and a digest of the samples it scored, which the run store records beside the numbers.

Each metric reports the share of the catalog it describes, so a reader sees which part of the
library a score speaks for. Splits are grouped by equivalence class, which changes nothing while
`sample_relation` is empty and becomes correct on its own once it is not. One seed fixes every split
and every draw, so a second run reproduces every number. `sampleripper cloud evaluate` records each
pass as a run in the tracking store beside the library (`samplecore.tracking`), one metric per
question under its own namespace and the whole report as an artifact, so two descriptors are
compared from the store rather than from two terminals; `--no-tracking` keeps a quick look out of
it. The harness itself returns the report, and `samplecloud.evaluation.recording` is the one place
that reads the report into a run. A pass keeps its finished stages in the partial beside the report
it writes (`samplecloud.evaluation.stages`), named by the experiment, the corpus and every setting:
each metric's result once computed, and the retuned probes' vectors as they are described, so a pass
stopped partway takes up after them, and the stages go once the report stands. A probe's retunings
are described together (`extract_many`).

This lives in `samplecloud` because it judges embeddings, which is what `samplecloud` owns. A learned
descriptor's vectors reach it as an ordinary experiment through the database, with no import in either
direction.

## Module cloud

`sampleripper cloud modules` (`samplecloud.modules`) lays modules out by the sounds of their
samples, read through the promoted experiment's standardized spectral vectors. A module stands for
the set of distinct samples it holds that carry a vector (`samplecloud.modules.membership`); a
module with none of them gets no coordinate. Two modules lie apart by the symmetric Chamfer distance
between their sets (`samplecloud.modules.distance`): each sample's distance to the other module's
closest sample, averaged over its own module, and the two directions averaged. Modules holding the
same samples lie exactly 0 apart, shared samples add nothing, and one extra sample moves a module by
its distance to the rest divided by twice the module's size, so a longer module sits beside the
shorter one it extends. Every sample's distance to every module is measured once, one module at a
time, and each pair's distance averages those rows.

UMAP lays the pairwise distances out directly (`samplecloud.modules.layout`, the `precomputed`
metric, with the seed and neighbor count the sample cloud uses), and each run reports how faithful
the plane is: the rank correlation between module distances and plane distances for the global
arrangement, and trustworthiness for the local one. A run replaces every module coordinate in one
transaction and records, under `cache/module-cloud` in the library root, the digest of the modules,
their samples and those samples' vectors it laid out, so a run finding the same ones ends with the
layout standing. While a layout is fitted, its directed distances are checkpointed batch by batch
(`samplecore.storage.staged_rows`) and its coordinates kept once fitted, so a run stopped partway
takes up after its last checkpoint. The pipeline's `module-cloud` step runs after `cloud`, since
the vectors it reads are the ones `cloud` promotes.

`GET /cloud/modules` carries each module's tracker format on its point, read with the coordinates in
one query (`PostgresModuleCloudCoordinateRepository.list_all_with_trackers`), since a module's format
is fixed by its bytes. The Cloud panel's Modules tab paints every module in its stamp's color
(`--tracker-xm`, `--tracker-it`, `--tracker-mod` and `--tracker-s3m`, which the `.badge-*` stamps read
too) through the slots the sample cloud paints by (`trackerColoring.ts`), and its legend lists the
formats the cloud holds with their module counts, each a switch for whether its modules are painted
or join the substrate.

## Labels on a sample

A sample is named by two kinds of label. The hand label is what a person wrote
(`SampleSummary.hand_label`, and the same field on the detail and preview models); the category is
what the listening model heard first, the top one of the scoring on show (`category`, read per
request through `top_category_labels` in `samplecore.storage.repositories.sample_category`, the
shown scoring resolved once per request by the `get_shown_experiment_id` dependency).
`CategoryBadge` is the single place the rule is applied: the hand label wins in a solid badge of its
own, the category stands in a dashed one, and a sample neither names reads as unlabeled -- an answer
carrying no category field included, so a server built before the field existed leaves the badge
saying what it knows. A category badge carries a swatch in its top-level tag's color, from the same
ranks the cloud paints by, so a badge and its point agree; a label too long for its cell ends in an
ellipsis with the whole wording in its tooltip.

The cloud colors by the hand labels' own tags or by the categories, with nothing about any tag
known to the frontend. `GET /curation/annotations/tags` reads the tag tree out of the labels through
`samplecore.labeling`, each tag with its count and a rank by the order it was first used, and
`GET /cloud/labels` carries every labeled sample's tags in the order the person wrote them, apart
from the points because a few hundred labels change with every label written while a hundred
thousand points change only with the embedding. `GET /cloud/categories` carries each sample's top
category as a tag path with its score, apart from the points in the same way, and
`GET /cloud/category-tags` the tags given as top categories with their counts, each counting toward
its top level and ranked by its place in the scoring's vocabulary; both answers are cached under the
id of the scoring on show, since a scoring's categories never change once written. The frontend paints a tag in
a color that is a function of its rank alone (`labelPalette.ts`: hues a golden angle apart, at the
lightness and chroma each theme declares), so a tag keeps its color as the vocabulary grows and a new
one takes the next hue; the legend is the picker, painting the most used top-level tags until a
person chooses their own, and a sample carrying several painted tags takes the first it was given
(`labelColoring.ts`). The legend ends the toolbar's one row, after the tabs and the choice of
coloring: the painted tags fill the rest of the row and scroll sideways, and the toggle drops every
tag into a panel of at most three rows over the cloud's top edge, so the cloud keeps its size. The
Cloud panel opens in the category mode, painted from the categories, with the labels one click away;
a panel 480 pixels wide or narrower, a phone's among them, keeps its toolbar to the tabs and a Legend
button, whose sheet holds that choice above the painted tags.
Every point outside the painted tags joins the substrate, on its recessive tone, and while a
mode's sources load every point waits there.

A sample's detail lists every category of the scoring on show (`SampleDetail.categories`, closest
first), each a dashed badge with its score beneath the label editor: a click writes the tag into the
hand label through `useAnnotationWriter`, the one write path every annotation gesture takes, reaching
the sample's near-duplicates the way the editor's own default does. The write follows the grammar's
own reading of one tag against another (`labelText.ts`, mirroring `SampleLabel.closure`): a category
the label already asserts shows as taken, a top level included once a specification under it is
written; a category more detailed than a tag the label names takes its place where it stood; and one
diverging below a shared top level goes in beside it.

## The shell on screen

`frontend/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` is what every address renders. It reads the view the address
names -- a panel, a sample or a module -- focuses the entity through `selectionStore`, and mounts
the workspace shell (`frontend/src/workspace/WorkspaceShell.tsx`), which keeps dockview and the
cloud mounted across navigations because every route renders the same component. Every panel is
described once in `frontend/src/workspace/panelRegistry.ts`: its component, the placement a
reopened panel returns to, whether dockview keeps its DOM while it is tabbed away (the cloud's
WebGL scene survives that way), the address that shows it, and where it lives on a phone. The
routes are generated from that registry, so `/cloud`, `/modules` and `/stats` open and reveal
their panels, while `/samples/{hash}` and `/modules/{hash}` reveal the details as before, and the
Morph panel's old `/morph` goes on to the cloud, where the morph lives now.

The first-run arrangement is drawn in `frontend/src/workspace/defaultLayout.ts` as dockview's own
serialized layout over a nominal box, which dockview scales to the window: the listings on the
left, the cloud in the middle, and an inspector of the details and the statistics on the right.
`frontend/src/workspace/dockviewPersistence.ts` saves every change under
a versioned record; a record of another version is discarded once and the default drawn again,
which is how a new arrangement reaches a browser that saved an older one. The top bar's View menu
opens and closes panels at their registered placement and resets the arrangement. Its Library menu
opens the setup page and quits the application, and appears where the setup routes answer, on the
machine the application runs on; its Help menu holds the guide, the diagnostics and About, which
shows the build version Vite's `define` writes in as the web app is built (`frontend/src/version.ts`):
the version in `pyproject.toml`, the commit and the minute in UTC, as `0.1.1.abcdef0.202609281825`
(`frontend/dev/buildVersion.ts`). The commit is the checkout's HEAD, or `SAMPLERIPPER_BUILD_COMMIT`
where the build has no git history: the site's image takes it as a build argument, which Railway
fills from `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` and `just docker-build` from the checkout.
The theme select sits beside them. Each panel renders inside a `PanelHost`, the scroll container that is also the
container its stylesheet rules query, so a panel fits the width it was given rather than the window's.
The Sample Detail panel stands the focused sample's transport
(`frontend/src/samples/SampleTransport.tsx`, the wavesurfer player over the one detail request
the panel reads) at one fixed height over the detail, which scrolls beneath it, the same
composition the phone's sample page shows at half that height, where the player is one row, the
play button and the file to save at either side of the waveform with the time in its corner, while
the workspace's player keeps the rate choice and the file beneath the waveform; both forms are
`frontend/src/samples/WavePanel.tsx`, which the morph strip's waveform takes as well, at the same
height. Either way the frame holds still while a sample or a morph sounds. The detail opens
on an Info tab, the sample's label, categories and properties,
with its spectral neighbors, occurrences, relations and co-occurrences each a tab beside it; the
panel holds the tab, so it outlives a change of sample.

Two shells mount that one registry. `frontend/src/layout/` reads the viewport as a layout mode,
`phone` below 768 pixels of width or 560 of height and `workspace` otherwise, and the primary
pointer as an input mode, `touch` when it is coarse; both are mirrored to `<html data-layout
data-input>` for the stylesheet. The viewport meta and `touch-action: pan-x pan-y` on the root
keep the page at one size, so a pinch and a double tap are the app's own to read. `AppShell` mounts `frontend/src/shell/phone/PhoneShell.tsx` for
the phone: every panel registered as a tab gets a surface, mounted on its first visit and kept
mounted out of sight (hidden and inert, never unmounted, so the cloud's canvas keeps its size and a
list its scroll offset), while a sample, a module or a panel with no tab opens as a page over the
tabs in the same frame, with the shell's header carrying its name. The tabs replace the address and
a page pushes one, so the back button always leaves a page for the tab it came from; a visit that
began on a page returns to the tab last remembered in `phoneShellStore`. The tray above the tabs is
the rendering of the highlight: it names whatever is in hand, the highlighted entity or the focused
sample, and offers play, the stars, the heart and the way to open it on one row, › or a double tap
on the name, which `frontend/src/shared/gestures/doubleTap.ts` counts from the taps themselves,
the label being written on the page or from a held row. A finger's tap on any sample row, in the listing, among a
sample's neighbors or in a module's samples, takes it in hand and plays it by the one rule in
`frontend/src/workspace/rowTap.ts`; the neighbors keep their columns in a narrow panel, where the
other mini tables stack each cell under its label. Each
listing publishes the order of the rows it shows to `frontend/src/workspace/listingOrderStore.ts`,
which a page's ‹ and › and the workspace's Alt+arrows step through, replacing the address each time.

## The cloud on screen

`frontend/src/cloud/CloudView.tsx` draws the cloud as a stack of layers inside `.cloud-wrap`, which
paints the theme's ground. From the bottom:

| Layer | Drawn by | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| `canvas.cloud-underlay` | `useUnderlay`, on a 2D canvas | the grid, and the density glow under a theme that declares one |
| `canvas.cloud-dots` | `regl-scatterplot` | every point as a dot; the pointer target for panning, zooming, hit-testing and selection |
| `canvas.cloud-nodes` | `useNodeLayer` and `hollowPointRenderer.ts`, on WebGL through `regl` | every point as a hollow square or ring of one size at every zoom |
| `svg.cloud-markers` | `CloudMarkers` | the hovered and the selected point, each in the theme's point shape |
| overlays | `CloudView`, `MorphLink` | the ping locating a highlighted point and the morph link |

regl-scatterplot draws every point into a 32-bit float framebuffer before the screen, which needs
`OES_texture_float`, `WEBGL_color_buffer_float` and `EXT_float_blend`; `frontend/src/cloud/floatRendering.ts`
probes them once per visit. Where WebGL is there but the float pipeline is not, or a person chose
plain dots in the diagnostics (`frontend/src/cloud/cloudDotsStore.ts`), the node layer draws every
point as a filled dot in the scatterplot's place (`frontend/src/cloud/plainDots.ts`), at the
theme's point size and growing with the zoom by the theme's scale mode as the scatterplot's points
would (`frontend/src/cloud/pointGrowth.ts`), the scatterplot keeping the camera and the hit-testing. The diagnostics sheet
(`frontend/src/shell/DiagnosticsSheet.tsx`), reached from the Help menu and the phone's More menu,
shows the probe's findings with the screen and the layout, for a phone with no console to read.

The dots' canvas takes the mouse through regl-scatterplot itself, which pans, zooms, hit-tests and
selects on its own handlers, and takes a finger through `frontend/src/cloud/touch/`, since the
library and its camera know only the mouse. `bindTouchGestures.ts` routes every pointer that is not
a mouse into a recognizer (`touchGestures.ts`, a state machine over pointer events with the timer
handed in) and cancels the touch start, so the browser raises no compatibility mouse events for the
library to misread; the click a tap may still raise is stopped before the canvas sees it. A tap
finds its point through `hitTest.ts`, a pass over the points' positions through the same
`ViewTransform` the overlays use, within a finger's reach; `CloudView` then selects and activates
it synchronously, inside the gesture, which is what lets playback start on a phone. A second tap in
the same place soon after, counted by `frontend/src/shared/gestures/doubleTap.ts`, opens the point
the first one took, the way a double click does. One finger
pans and two pinch through `cameraControl.ts`, which drives `scatterplot.get("camera")` directly:
a pan is a translation in the camera's normalized space, half the surface's height being one
unit, and a pinch a scale about the fingers' midpoint; every move ends in `redraw()`, and the
frame that follows publishes `drawing`, so the layers sync as they do for the mouse. A held finger
reports its point for a menu.

Every layer moves within the frame that draws the points. The scatterplot publishes its `drawing`
event synchronously inside the animation frame rendering a moved view, and `CloudView` answers it,
and every resize of the container, in one pass (`syncView`): it derives a `ViewTransform` from the
camera matrix (`viewTransform.ts`), repaints the underlay and the node layer through it, and commits
the overlays' positions from `getScreenPosition` through `flushSync`, so the frame paints dots,
nodes, grid and markers from one view. With `W` and `H` the container's size in CSS pixels and
`view` the column-major camera matrix, the scatterplot places a data point `(x, y)` at

```
screenX = W/2 + (H/2) * (view[0] * x + view[4] * y + view[12])
screenY = H/2 - (H/2) * (view[1] * x + view[5] * y + view[13])
```

Half the height is one clip unit on both axes, which keeps the data square in a panel of any aspect.

The scatterplot draws each palette slot at a size and opacity of its own, the substrate's slot
first, finer and fainter, so the named points stand on a ground whose density still shows. The
active and hover colors arrive as one color per slot, which paints a selected or hovered categorical
point in the theme's own selection and hover colors. The library compiles the point shape into its
shaders at creation, so a theme that changes `--cloud-point-shape` recreates the scatterplot with its
camera carried over.

`--cloud-node-mode` sets when the node layer takes over from the dots, through a short crossfade of
the two canvases (`.cloud-wrap-nodes`): `always` at every zoom, and `detail` once the view holds at
most as many points as markers covering 30% of the surface (`detailLevel.ts`). The node shader
places every frame on the device's pixel grid, so a one-pixel outline stays crisp at any pixel ratio,
and paints it from the palette the dots use, the substrate at `--cloud-node-substrate-opacity`.

The grid's lines stand a power of two apart in data units, the smallest step keeping them at least
`--cloud-grid-spacing` pixels apart (`gridSpacing.ts`), so a zoom halves or doubles the grid in
place; every line is a row, every fourth a beat and every sixteenth a measure, each rank in its own
color, drawn on both axes or as vertical lines with a zero line across `y = 0`. The glow, under a
theme with a positive `--cloud-glow-opacity`, is one image built whenever the points or their colors
change (`densityGlow.ts`): the named points counted into a 256 by 256 field over the normalized data
domain, blurred by three box passes, each cell in the average color of its points and as opaque as
the logarithm of its count. The underlay stretches that image over the screen box its domain covers.

Every visual value above is a CSS custom property in `styles.css` (`--cloud-point-*`,
`--cloud-substrate-*`, `--cloud-marker-*`, `--cloud-node-*`, `--cloud-grid-*`, `--cloud-glow-opacity`,
`--cloud-link-*`, `--cloud-ping-*`, `--cloud-hover-color`), so the themes differ
in tokens alone: `cloudRenderSettings.ts` reads the ones the canvases use into one
`CloudRenderSettings` whenever the theme changes, and the SVG overlays take theirs through CSS. The
dark and light themes draw round dots over their substrate, rings in detail, cased markers and a
solid accent link. The OpenMPT theme draws its envelope editor: a black ground, a vertical grid,
every point a hollow square in its painted tag's color at every zoom, the selected point yellow and the
morph pair joined by a yellow line. A system dark preference applies the dark block beneath a chosen
OpenMPT theme as well, so the OpenMPT block declares every token the dark block declares.

The controls follow the same rule. Every push button is `.button` with a variant naming its intent
(`button-primary`, `button-quiet`, `button-icon`, `button-wide`), rendered through
`shared/controls/Button.tsx` or, for a link or a menu's summary, `buttonClassName`; the fields,
checks, bars, group boxes and list boxes are `.field`, `.check`, `.progress`, `.group` and
`.listbox`. Each takes its look from the `--button-*`, `--field-*`, `--check-*`, `--progress-*`,
`--group-*`, `--list-*`, `--pane-tab-*` and `--sheet-*` tokens on `:root`, which the light and dark
themes fill from their surfaces and the OpenMPT theme fills with Windows 10 literals: 75px square
buttons with a blue ring on the default one and gray text when disabled, sunken white fields, square
black-on-white checks, a green bar, etched group captions and a flat menu bar. A page wanting larger
controls, as the setup page does, sets `--button-height` and `--field-height` on itself, since
`--control-height` is resolved on `:root`. The controls' icons are shapes drawn on one grid in
`frontend/src/shared/icons`, outlined or filled, the play triangle centered on its own centroid,
so every browser renders them alike.

## Morphs in the application

A morph is a pair of samples and a weight between them, held in `frontend/src/morph/morphStore.ts`
apart from the shell's focus and highlight: the samples a person picks fill it, so it stays where it
was put while a person goes on browsing. One end is always selected (`selectedEnd` in the store), A
at the start of a visit, and it takes every sample picked through `takeSample`, called from the two
places a tap takes a sample in hand, the plain click of
`frontend/src/workspace/useEntityRowInteractions.ts` and `CloudPanel.handleSelect`. While the other
end is empty the selection moves there once the selected end takes a sample, so the first two picks
make a pair; a sample the pair already holds leaves the pair and the selection as they stand, so
the second click of a double click, or a tap to hear an end again, holds the pair in place. The
strip along the bottom of the Cloud panel (`frontend/src/morph/MorphStrip.tsx`) shows the pair as
two slots, A and B; tapping a slot selects its end, and a chosen end plays and is taken in hand. A
whole pair draws a line between the two ends' markers on the cloud with a knob on it that is the
weight (`frontend/src/cloud/MorphLink.tsx`), moving with the points through pan and zoom like every
overlay on the cloud. Once both ends are chosen a slider mirroring the knob's weight stands under
the row, with the distance between the ends on a desktop, and the waveform button opens the render
drawn over both ends' traces beneath it. Every point is heard through
`frontend/src/morph/useMorphPlayback.ts`, which plays the render through the one preview element
every sample plays through (`useAudioPreview`, whose sources carry a URL and a key, so a morph is
keyed by its own render's address) and records the weight in `morphStore`, so the waveform draws
whichever control let go last; a pair just completed is drawn at the slider's point by the store's
`pairOf` before any point of it is heard, so the ends are heard first. Every change to the ends
passes through the store's one `commit`, which keeps the history `frontend/src/morph/morphHistory.ts`
defines: a column per end of the samples it has held (`held`, newest arrival first, each once, kept
across visits under one localStorage key by `morphHistoryPersistence.ts`) and a line of snapshots
behind the present (`past` and `future`, the ends with the weight and the drawn point) that `undo`
and `redo` walk, so a row keeps its place and the pair marks its rows by holding their samples.
`frontend/src/morph/useMorphUndoKeys.ts`, mounted in `AppShell`, hands Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y to the
store from anywhere but a text field, whose own undo the browser keeps; the history button on the
strip opens `MorphHistory.tsx` under it on the workspace, or as a sheet on a phone, and a click on
a row names its end through `setEnd`. The opened strip states how far apart the two ends sit
(`frontend/src/morph/MorphDistance.tsx`, over `GET /samples/{hash}/distance/{other}`), so the length
of the path is read where the path is traveled. Both ends are carried into one frame before they blend: the API resolves the
rate each is heard at by the one rule every reader of the catalog applies and hands both to the
inference process, which resamples the slower sample up to the faster one's rate, the higher of
the two, so the faster keeps its whole band and the slower loses nothing, and states that rate in
the file it answers with. The frontend plays a morph as the file says, so a path between two
samples an octave apart in rate holds each end at its own pitch and sounds every point between
at the one rate, where a blend in the stored frame played at a rate sliding between the two would
carry both ends' pitches through the gap. Weights lie on a grid of sixteenths on both sides, so a
weight names one render and one cache entry wherever it goes.

## Extending to new tracker formats

`sampleextract`'s format dispatch is a small registry (module suffix → loader function), not
branching logic; MOD and S3M (added once `trackmod`'s own readers for both were already complete)
extended it with two registry entries each. Each format gets a member of the `TrackerFormat` enum,
both schema-level and reachable through `module.tracker`'s `CheckConstraint`, and a tracker-specific
properties table for whatever it stores beyond the shared `sample_properties` base -- `xm_sample_properties`
(tuning), `it_sample_properties` (global volume, sustain loop, filename, vibrato), and
`s3m_sample_properties` (filename). MOD gets no properties table at all: TrackMod's MOD reader folds
its finetune byte straight into the shared `rate` field and keeps no separate raw copy, and the
format stores no per-sample panning, sustain loop, filename, or vibrato of its own, so
`MODSampleProperties` carries nothing beyond the shared base -- a format's own subtype and
discriminator tag are added regardless of whether it turns out to need a child table. The content
store and the API's read shape stay as they are: content addressing and the served response models
are already format-agnostic.
