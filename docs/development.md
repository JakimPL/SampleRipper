# Development

This guide is for contributors: the checks every change passes, the tests, the sandbox library, and
where generated files go. Set up a checkout first, as [Running from source](source.md) shows.

## Before you change code

Read [the guidelines](guidelines.md): they set the code's style, typing, error handling and
documentation rules. [The architecture](architecture.md) maps which package owns what, and how the
project uses its databases.

## Checks

`just check` runs everything a change has to pass before it is pushed: the commit hooks over every
file, linting and every test of the Python code, then the same for the web app. It takes several
minutes. Its parts run on their own too:

- `just format`: isort and black.
- `just lint`: codespell, mypy, pylint and import-linter. pylint fails on any message, even while
  its score reads 10.00, so read its messages or its exit status.
- `just test`: the tests but the pipeline scenarios, in about two minutes; `just test-all` adds
  them, and `just test-scenarios` runs them alone. `just coverage` also reports the lines the tests
  leave unrun.
- `just frontend-check`: type checking, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and the web app's tests.

`just install` sets up git hooks. Formatting, spelling and secret scanning run on every commit. A
push goes through once `just check` has passed on the commit it sends, with no file changed
meanwhile: the check marks that commit, and the push hook only looks the mark up, since git holds
the connection to GitHub open while the hook runs. Commit, run `just check`, then push.

## Tests

The tests run against the `sampleripper_test` database on the server `config.toml` names;
`SAMPLERIPPER_TEST_DATABASE_URL` names another one. Two slower suites run on their own:

- `just test-pipeline` builds a tiny library with every real program, the listening model and
  training included, on the processor.
- `just explore-pipeline` acts on a small library in orders drawn at random for a few minutes,
  holding every run of the pipeline to its checks.

## The sandbox library

`just dev-build` writes a sandbox of 30 modules, 300 one-shots and ten labels into `dev-library/`
and builds it, in the `sampleripper_dev` database on your configured server. `just dev <command>`
runs a `sampleripper` command on it, `just serve-dev` serves it read-only on port 8001, `just
app-dev` runs the SampleRipper app on it, which records labels, and `just dev-reset` empties its
database and deletes its files. Both serve through the roles `config.toml` names in
`server_database_url` and `curation_database_url`, on the sandbox's database; run `just database`
once after naming them.

To browse it, start the web app with `VITE_BACKEND_DEV_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001 just frontend-dev`.
The sandbox holds a few dozen samples; `VITE_CLOUD_DENSIFY=100000` added to that command grows its
cloud to a hundred thousand points, each borrowing a real sample's identity, so hovering, playing
and morphing work on every point. `VITE_CLOUD_DENSIFY_MODULES` does the same for the Modules tab.

## The web app

The web app lives in `frontend/`: React, built with Vite. `just frontend-install` installs its
packages, and `just frontend-dev` runs it with changes applied as you save.

Its API types are generated from the API itself. After changing a route or a model the API
returns, run `just frontend-types`: it writes both OpenAPI schemas into `build/schemas/` and
regenerates `frontend/src/api/schema.ts` and `setupSchema.ts`, which are committed.

### Messages

Every sentence the web app shows lives in the English catalog under `frontend/src/messages/`, one
file per area in `areas/`, written as ICU messages. Components read them through `useMessages()`
with typed ids (`text(M.cloud.empty.title)`); plurals, lists and dates belong in the message, so a
translation can reorder a sentence freely. ESLint rejects literal text in `src/`.

When the server refuses a request, it answers with a code and the values the sentence names
(`samplecore/problems.py`), and `frontend/src/api/problem.ts` maps each code to a catalog message.
A new refusal the web app shows needs a `MessageCode`, a catalog message and an entry in that map;
the type checker flags a missing one.

Under test, messages render as their ids, so a test names the message that should appear
(`getByText(M.cloud.empty.title)`) and sees values through `keyed(...)` from
`frontend/tests/support/keyedMessages.ts`. Real English appears only in the few tests of how a
message handles counts and durations, through `englishText(...)`.

The command line's messages stay in each package's `messages.py` as format strings, and
`sampleripper/app/messages.py`, `samplecore/messages.py` hold the ones several commands share.

## Where generated files go

Source folders hold source alone. Everything generated goes to one of three top-level folders:

```
build/                    intermediate files, safe to delete
  frontend/               the built web app: `just app` serves it, the wheel and the Docker image copy it
  schemas/                the OpenAPI schemas `just frontend-types` reads
  package/                the wheel and its pinned requirements, which `just executable` reads
bin/                      the executable `just executable` builds
dist/                     the files a release publishes
```

The folder of the built web app is named in three places: `frontend/vite.config.ts` writes it, and
`src/samplecore/paths.py` and `hatch_build.py` read it. [Building and releasing](building.md)
describes `bin/` and `dist/`.

## Recipes

| Recipe | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | Runs every check a push needs, and marks the commit it passed on |
| `just format`, `just lint`, `just test`, `just coverage` | Run one part of the Python checks |
| `just test-all`, `just test-scenarios` | Run every test, or the pipeline scenarios alone |
| `just test-pipeline` | Builds a tiny library with every real program, on the processor |
| `just explore-pipeline` | Runs the pipeline in random orders for a few minutes, checking every run |
| `just frontend-install`, `just frontend-check` | Install the web app's packages, and check it |
| `just frontend-types` | Regenerates the web app's API types from the API |
| `just dev-build`, `just dev <command>`, `just serve-dev`, `just dev-reset` | Build the sandbox, run a command on it, serve it on port 8001, and remove it |
