/**
 * The morph as a waveform, over the traces of the two samples it runs between, laid out as a
 * sample's player is: one row on a phone, the frame over a transport elsewhere.
 *
 * The frame spans the longer end, which holds still as the weight moves: a render lasts the
 * geometric path between the two ends' own lengths, so it always falls between them, and each end
 * keeps the length it is heard at in the pair's frame. Every contour therefore stands where it
 * really falls in time, all three decoded in the browser at the same detail, so a render reads
 * against its ends as one drawing rather than against a coarser sketch of them. The frame shows
 * the drawing as pending until all three are read, and again while a newly let-go point decodes.
 *
 * A pair just completed is drawn at the slider's point before it is heard, so the ends themselves
 * are heard first. The render sounds through the one preview element every sample plays through,
 * which is what the cloud's own marker plays as well, so a weight let go in either place is heard
 * once. The waveform follows that sound rather than making it, and the play button sounds the
 * point drawn. Where a point is refused or cannot be read, the transport says so in the server's
 * own words, and while no inference process answers the frame keeps to the ends and asks for
 * nothing, the strip above saying that morphing is offline.
