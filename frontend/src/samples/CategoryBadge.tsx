/**
 * The badge naming what a sample is, wherever a sample's name appears.
 *
 * A hand label wins, being what a person actually decided, and wears a solid style of its own. In
 * its place stands what the listening model heard first, in the dashed style a machine-made
 * statement takes, with a swatch in its top level's color; a sample neither has named reads as
 * unlabeled, an answer carrying no category field included, so a server built before the field
 * existed leaves the badge saying what it knows. The label set in this session counts at once, so a
 * badge follows an edit the moment it is made. A label longer than the room it is given ends in an
 * ellipsis, whole in its tooltip.
