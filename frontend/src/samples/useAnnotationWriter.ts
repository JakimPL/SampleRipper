/**
 * One place a decision about a sample is written from, wherever it is made.
 *
 * A change reaches as far as `scope` says, in turn with every other change to the same samples, and
 * the session store shows it at once. Once the server has answered, the cached requests describing
 * those samples are dropped, and a new wording also drops the vocabulary, the tag tree and the
 * cloud's labels, so every mounted view asks again and paints the sample by what was just said. A
 * failure is kept beside the sample for whichever view shows it. Where the person here may change
 * nothing, `change` is null, the one thing every control checks to show what the sample holds alone.
