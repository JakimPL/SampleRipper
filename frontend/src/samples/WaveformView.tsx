 * theme could have changed, the way every canvas-backed visual in the app is, and whenever the
 * frame is resized, since a canvas holds the pixels it was given. A notice stands in the frame
 * itself where a contour is missing, so the reason is read where the contour would have been
 * rather than in a row of its own.
 *
 * While the waveform is on its way the frame is marked busy and its pending layer shows a faint
 * zero line with a highlight sweeping along it, the drawing standing dimmed beneath; the stylesheet
