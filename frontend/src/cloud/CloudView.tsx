/**
 * Renders sample or module positions as a WebGL scatterplot, generic over which kind of entity
 * each point names -- the same component and picking contract serves both the Samples and Modules
 * cloud tabs. Owns regl-scatterplot as this codebase's one file touching that library's own API,
 * mirroring how `useWaveformPlayer.ts` owns wavesurfer.js's.
 *
 * A single click selects the point under the cursor through regl-scatterplot's own hit-testing,
 * and clears the shell-wide highlight when the click misses every point. regl-scatterplot's own
 * double-click behavior only deselects, so this view disables it (`deselectOnDblClick: false`)
 * and focuses the hovered point on a native double-click instead, looked up through the library's
 * continuous `pointOver`/`pointOut` hover tracking -- the same tracking a miss-click reads to tell
 * a hit from empty space, and that `onHover` reports upward for a caller-rendered detail popup.
 * Pressing Escape while the canvas has focus clears the highlight too, through the library's own
 * built-in `deselect` behavior. Whenever `highlighted` changes to a point present in this view (a
 * click elsewhere in the shell just located a sample or module here), a brief sonar-style ping
 * marks its screen position, pinned to the point through any pan or zoom while it plays. Selecting a point
 * this way also reports it through `onActivate` (a sample tab's caller uses this to start playback),
 * but skips its own ping for that one transition: the click that just selected it is already looking
 * straight at it, so the locate cue is reserved for a highlight arriving from somewhere else in the
 * shell. The browser's own menu stays off the canvas. When `link` names two points in view, a line
 * joins them and its marker is the weight; the hover tracking pauses while the marker is dragged,
 * since the library keeps hit-testing beneath it.
 *
 * A finger works through its own layer (`touch/`), since the library and its camera know only the
 * mouse: a tap selects and activates the point under it within a finger's reach, synchronously,
 * so a caller's playback starts inside the gesture the browser allows sound from; a tap on empty
 * space clears; a second tap in the same place soon after focuses the point the first one took,
 * the way a double click does; a held finger reports its point through `onContextMenu`; one finger
 * pans and two pinch, each move driving the camera and asking for the frame that shows it. A
 * `command` centers the view on a point, frames a pair or steps the zoom, once per sequence number.
 *
 * The selected and the hovered point each carry a marker in the theme's point shape. Every overlay
 * -- the markers, the ping and the link -- follows the library's `drawing` event, which
 * arrives within the frame that drew a moved view, and a resize of the container, and commits
 * before that frame paints, so the overlays move in step with the points.
 *
 * Where the browser cannot blend into float buffers, which regl-scatterplot draws every point
 * through, or a person chose plain dots, the node layer draws every point as a filled dot in the
 * scatterplot's place, at the theme's point size and growing with the zoom as the scatterplot's
 * points would, the scatterplot keeping the camera and the hit-testing.
 *
 * How the points look comes from the theme through `useCloudRenderSettings`: size, shape, opacity
 * and colors are handed to the library at creation and re-applied through its own `set` whenever
 * the theme changes. Points draw with regl-scatterplot's own categorical coloring, one color and
 * one opacity per palette slot, the substrate's slot -- the points no painted entry reaches --
 * fainter than the rest and drawn beneath it, so the named structure stands on
 * a ground whose density still shows. The active and hover colors come as one per slot, which is
 * what paints a selected or hovered point in the theme's own selection and hover colors. The
 * library compiles a point's shape into its shaders at creation, so a theme that changes the shape
 * recreates the scatterplot, carrying the camera over so the view stays where it was.
 *
 * A second canvas over the dots, the node layer, draws every point as a hollow marker of one size
 * whatever the zoom -- a square under square points, a ring under round ones -- and takes over from
 * the dots through a short crossfade: at every zoom under a theme whose nodes always show, and under
 * one that shows them in detail once the view holds few enough points for the markers to stay
 * legible. It follows the view within the same frame the overlays do, and so does the underlay: a
 * canvas beneath the dots that paints the theme's grid, its lines ranked as rows, beats and measures
 * and locked to the camera, so the grid pans and zooms with the points on it. Under a theme with a
 * glow, the underlay also lays a blurred haze over the grid wherever the named points gather, each
 * cluster in its own colors.
