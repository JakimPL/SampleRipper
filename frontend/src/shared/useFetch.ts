 * Runs `loader` on mount and whenever `deps` changes, exposing the request's progress as a
 * `FetchState`. When `cacheKey` is given, a settled result already cached under that key (by an
 * earlier call anywhere, under the same key) seeds the very first render directly instead of
 * showing a loading state that would immediately flip to data already on hand; the request itself
 * also runs through the same cache, so two components mounted with the same `cacheKey` share one
 * underlying request rather than issuing it twice. A keyed hook asks again whenever its key is
 * invalidated, keeping the answer it has on screen until the new one arrives, which is what lets a
 * mounted cloud repaint by a label written a moment ago. `enabled` holds a request back until it is
 * wanted, which is what lets a panel mount every source it may color by while fetching only the
 * one it shows.
