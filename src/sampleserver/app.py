    """Build the FastAPI app serving the catalog at the given database URL, as ``role`` allows, to whom ``server`` says.

    What the app shows and whom it answers follow from ``server``'s exposure alone, through the
    `ServingPolicy` it derives (`sampleserver.policy`): every request passes `AdmittedRequestsOnly`
    first, and every route reading a path, a person's labels or an internal address asks the policy
    whether to show it. A sample's file is opened only inside ``sample_directories``. Every response
    states what a browser may do with it (`sampleserver.headers.SecurityHeaders`). Where the policy
    limits visitors, each is held to a request budget and a morph budget (`sampleserver.visitors`).

    Every route reads the catalog through a pooled connection Postgres itself refuses a write on. A
    curator also serves the route recording a person's own decisions about samples, in a schema of
    their own, and only to the person at the computer it runs on: what this application records is
    what a listener decided, and the catalog stays the offline pipelines' to build. A reader, what a
    deployed site runs, serves no route that writes. Morphs are rendered by a separate inference
    process at `inference_url`, which the morph routes reach over HTTP, so the models and the
    libraries behind them stay out of this process.

    Every route is served under `API_PREFIX`, which keeps the whole API inside one path segment
    the single-page application's own routes stay clear of: the frontend reaches `/api/samples`
    while a person's browser holds `/samples/{hash}`, so one path always names one thing. A
    response past a kilobyte goes out gzipped when the caller accepts it: the cloud's hundred
    thousand points are text that compresses several-fold, and the lightest level costs a fraction
    of a second per request against tens of megabytes saved on the wire; audio and byte ranges
    pass through as they are.

    A pure factory, deliberately without any module-level instance built from real
    configuration -- that belongs to `sampleserver.main`, the actual ASGI entry point, so that
    importing this module (as tests do, to build an app over a temporary catalog) never depends
    on a real `config.toml` existing. The connections this factory arranges are opened at startup
    rather than at build time, for the same reason.

        The app creates nothing: its role may read and, for a curator, write labels, so the schema

        live as long as the app, so their connections are reused across requests, and both are
        closed when the app stops. Every request reaches the pool through one `CatalogConnections`,
